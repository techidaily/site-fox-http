### Introducing Default Albums

The introduction of the iCloud drive that is usually supported by the devices iOS 5 and iPhone 3Gs and the later models, has made the iPhone photo album organization quite easy and hassle free. Apart from the ‘all photo album’, there are few default albums as well. What are the default albums? The images or the photos are often categorized as the selfies or screenshots favorites, etc. The iPhone automatically create and name the albums to a particular category of videos or photos, which are usually known as the default albums.

Videos album- You can find all the videos at one folder in video album.

Selfies- The images that require a front facing camera captures, are automatically stored in the Selfie album.

Screenshots- When you press the home and power button together, the screenshots of your iPhone are created and saved in the Screenshots photo album.

Places- Have you enabled location services on your iPhone? If so, then this is an ultimate way to recollect when and where you went and clicked any particular or all Apple iPhone photos at one place.

Step2 Drag the songs to the **“Timeline Panel”** at the bottom. Then, right-click only that song whose silent parts you want to eliminate. Now, select the option **“Silence Detection.”** This feature detects moments of silence and automatically remove them based on the criteria you designate to craft high-end videos with no annoying pauses.

**_P.S.:_** Audio Ducking can automatically lower the volume of one track to make another track clearer when you're recording voiceovers, narrations, translations, podcasts, YouTube videos, and other productions that benefit from lowering background music under speech.

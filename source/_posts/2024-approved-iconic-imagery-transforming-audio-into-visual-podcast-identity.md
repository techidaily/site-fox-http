### Where to use

You can think of your podcast logo as a representation of your brand. Your podcast logo will be visible on all your podcast covers. You can also use your logo on websites and when you market your products.

### When to use

You can use your logo on your profile pictures and author detail sections. It can also act as your thumbnail. You can also add your logo to video podcasts to spread your brand.

## Part 2\. Do I Need a Logo for My Podcast?

Many users feel that visuals are a minor aspect of podcasts and often overlook it. It's true that podcasts mainly consist of audio, but a visual representation is just as important. Let's go over why having a good podcast logo is crucial.

* Sets the first impression for new listeners.

### · Enhance Personal Space

For professional video conferences, you need to be more presentable and active. You don't have to do much to achieve what you want with Zoom Meetings. Turn on the 'Touch up Appearance.' Focus on the lighting where you are going to sit. Lastly, make sure you raise the computer to your eye level. This makes you look active and confident.

### · React with Emoji

Another tip for using Zoom Meetings like a pro is its emoji feature. With Zoom Meetings, a video conferencing tool, you can react with emojis on your screen. Even if you are muted, the emojis will speak for you on the screen.

### Bottom Line

This article is all about Zoom Meetings. The tool can be used like professionals only if you take notes from this article. We started the discussion by sharing various ways to improve the Zoom video resolution. Later we also talked about a few tips that could be adopted to get comfortable with the tool.

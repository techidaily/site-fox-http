### 4\. Do you need an internet connection to use Adobe Creative Cloud desktop app?

No. However, your computer must have the software to use the desktop apps in **Adobe Creative Cloud storage**, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Consequently, you can utilize them without a constant Internet connection.

The initial installation and licensing of your apps both require an Internet connection. Every 30 days, the desktop programs attempt to verify your software licenses.

### 5\. Can I put my Adobe application on a different computer?

You can install your **Adobe cloud storage** software on multiple computers and sign in (activate) on two of them but use it on only one device at a time with your license.

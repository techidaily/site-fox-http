#### 2\. **Trimming**

 After you have imported the videos, cut the unnecessary portion of the videos that you are not interested to include, this trimming or cutting should be done before you start the actual editing.  
For that, click on the thumbnails of the videos and then on "play". This will result into playing the video. There are two trimming buttons on the left of the window that you can use for marking the beginning and ending of the clip which you want to include. In this way, you can select the number of videos clips that you want to include in your video.

Don't forget to click on "remember setting" button after you have made the settings otherwise it will not save the settings that you would have made.

#### 5\. **Adding Title**

 Now, GoPro Studio will offer you two options; creating a totally new video or using the templates in the software. In the case you choose the second option, you need to do only one thing which is replacing the videos with the selected files.

 For creating the new video, click on "Blank" button and then on "create". Now, click on the "Title" button and type the title name that you want.

#### 6\. **Adding and Editing the video**

 Now, choose the video and add it by dragging and dropping to the timeline. After including the video, you can adjust the speed, fade time, brightness, volume level and many other features. You can also add the night vision feel to the video. As you have done in the importing; you can also adjust the duration of every clip that you are going to add in the video. Selecting the "Razor blade" symbol will divide the clip in two parts and if you click on "+"symbol, it will create the the fade effects in the video. The fade out effects are added so that the video will not end suddenly. So, when done with adding the clips then, add the fade out effect to the video. Click on the "Video Controls" and increase the limit on the fade out line.

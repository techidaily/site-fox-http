## Part 2: Review in detail on Luminance HDR

Luminance HDR software is a free tool and it offers users a simple way to create and edit HDR images efficiently. It identifies data correctly and it supports lots of decent features that users can take advantage of when executing HDR image editing or creation tasks.

In the current development after almost two years, Luminance HDR has optimized different aspects to fix bugs, enhance its speed, and lots more. Some new developments introduced include a better CLI interface, better HDPI support, automatic adjustments of LDRs levels, a new Dark theme, and fast export.

We've outlined some of the features of Luminance HDR below;

1. HDR Editing

In terms of editing, you can rely on Luminance HDR for cool editing features that can always come in handy when you're looking to edit HDR images. From resizing to cropping, rotating, etc. Keep reading to know more about the editing featured on Luminance HDR.

1. HDR Processing

Luminance HDR separates the processing of HDR images into two phases: The creation of HDR images and its conversion to an LDR image.

So, in all, we could say the Luminance HDR processing is reliable.

1. UI and Layout

The Luminous HDR interface is fairly responsive, but some of the features are quite confusing, making it challenging. Users can set a preferred interface theme and set it if they want it to always show in the preview panel window.

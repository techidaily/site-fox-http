## How to Distort Text in Photography Using Photoshop

If you are looking for ways to combine art and words, Photoshop offers the right tools to help you add creative effects to text. You can apply text distortion to product logos, headers for a blog, or headers you would like to use in other marketing materials to make them stand out.

By typing normal characters and applying changes with a few clicks in the program, you will save yourself the time and money that you would have used in outsourcing custom designs.

The bottom line is: Distorting text in Photoshop is a simple process that requires patience and a little know-how. You can distort the text in many ways, making it a useful tool for creating various looks for your designs.

With that in mind, let's look at how you can apply text distortion in photography using Photoshop.

### Step 1\

Start Photoshop, and then click on the File menu. Select the New option and set parameters for your document, according to the space the text is going to occupy in its intended medium. In the Name field, type a name. You can also decide to leave the Photoshop default.

### Step 2\

Click the Window menu to open the Layers panel and click Layers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 4\

Click on the T icon located in the Tools panel. You can also click on the Window and select Tools if you don't see the Tools panel. After opening the Type toolbar, choose the text size, color, and font you'll use for the distorted text. Now, click the canvas, and then type the text you want to distort. The text appears in a non-distorted format when you type.

### Step 5\

Check the list and right-click on the new text layer with a T icon symbol and the words you have typed. Select the Rasterize Layer option; this will turn the box with the T icon into a white and gray checkerboard.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 6\

Click on the Edit menu, then hover your cursor over Transform. From the fly-out menu, choose Distort. A border encircled with white boxes will surround the text on the canvas. Click and pull a corner box away from the text, like toward a corner of the Adobe Photoshop work area.

Be sure to pull it in different directions and check how the text will become funhouse-style elongated in different ways; this will allow you to judge which look you prefer for your text distortion.

### Step 7\

Now, click another corner and drag towards the center to make the text look like it's slightly squished.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 8\

Take one of the middleboxes and pull and drug them on either the bottom or top to make the text wider.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 9\

Tinker around with different changes mentioned above until you get the text distortion you want. Once you are satisfied with the results, hit Enter to set the change and get rid of the boxes and borders from the text.

### Step 10\

Select the File menu and click Save As. Photoshop will automatically have "PSD" displayed in the Format box, which allows you to save your file as a proprietary Photoshop PSD. Make sure you leave this extension, as it lets you re-access the design layers and perform more text distortions in the future. Now, click on Save.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 11\

Go to the File menu and click on it. Select the Save As option again. Choose your preferred graphic format and click Save. Photoshop will prompt you about discarding layers. When you see this, click OK or Yes. Doing this will render your text uneditable and allow anyone with an image viewer to open your graphic instead of only Photoshop. It will also allow you to include it in word processing documents, websites, and other materials.

#### Add Noise to the Text

Select your text and then go to Filter - Noise - Add Noise; this will add Noise to the text. Next, select your text again and go to Filter -Blur -Gaussian Blur; this will blur the edges of the text to help smooth out the distortion.

#### Make the Text Look like Ink with a Smudge Tool

You can add a texture overlay for more texture and dimension to your text. To do this, click on the Text option in the Toolbox and select the dropdown that says Add Texture Overlay; this opens a new window, and you can click on your image to choose the texture.

Now, click another corner and drag towards the center to make the text look like it's slightly squished.

### Step 8\

### Step 10\

Select the File menu and click Save As. Photoshop will automatically have "PSD" displayed in the Format box, which allows you to save your file as a proprietary Photoshop PSD.

### Step 11\

Go to the File menu and click on it. Select the Save As option again. Choose your preferred graphic format and click Save. Photoshop will prompt you about discarding layers. When you see this, click OK or Yes. Doing this will render your text uneditable and allow anyone with an image viewer to open your graphic instead of only Photoshop. It will also allow you to include it in word processing documents, websites, and other materials.

#### Add Noise to the Text

Select your text and then go to Filter - Noise - Add Noise; this will add Noise to the text. Next, select your text again and go to Filter -Blur -Gaussian Blur; this will blur the edges of the text to help smooth out the distortion.

#### Make the Text Look like Ink with a Smudge Tool

You can add a texture overlay for more texture and dimension to your text. To do this, click on the Text option in the Toolbox and select the dropdown that says Add Texture Overlay; this opens a new window, and you can click on your image to choose the texture.

Distortion of text is referred to as the alteration of the original characteristics or shape of a text. Most people use text distortion to add uniqueness to their photos or videos and make sure their projects stand out from the pack.

## How to Distort Text in Photography Using Photoshop

If you are looking for ways to combine art and words, Photoshop offers the right tools to help you add creative effects to text. You can apply text distortion to product logos, headers for a blog, or headers you would like to use in other marketing materials to make them stand out.

### Step 1\

### Step 1\

Start Photoshop, and then click on the File menu. Select the New option and set parameters for your document, according to the space the text is going to occupy in its intended medium. In the Name field, type a name. You can also decide to leave the Photoshop default.

The text appears in a non-distorted format when you type.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 6\

Click on the Edit menu, then hover your cursor over Transform. From the fly-out menu, choose Distort. A border encircled with white boxes will surround the text on the canvas. Click and pull a corner box away from the text, like toward a corner of the Adobe Photoshop work area.

Be sure to pull it in different directions and check how the text will become funhouse-style elongated in different ways; this will allow you to judge which look you prefer for your text distortion.

### Step 7\

Now, click another corner and drag towards the center to make the text look like it's slightly squished.

### Step 8\

Take one of the middleboxes and pull and drug them on either the bottom or top to make the text wider.

### Step 9\

Tinker around with different changes mentioned above until you get the text distortion you want. Once you are satisfied with the results, hit Enter to set the change and get rid of the boxes and borders from the text.

### Step 10\

Select the File menu and click Save As. Photoshop will automatically have "PSD" displayed in the Format box, which allows you to save your file as a proprietary Photoshop PSD. Make sure you leave this extension, as it lets you re-access the design layers and perform more text distortions in the future. Now, click on Save.

### Step 11\

Go to the File menu and click on it. Select the Save As option again. Choose your preferred graphic format and click Save. Photoshop will prompt you about discarding layers. When you see this, click OK or Yes. Doing this will render your text uneditable and allow anyone with an image viewer to open your graphic instead of only Photoshop. It will also allow you to include it in word processing documents, websites, and other materials.

#### Add Noise to the Text

Select your text and then go to Filter - Noise - Add Noise; this will add Noise to the text. Next, select your text again and go to Filter -Blur -Gaussian Blur; this will blur the edges of the text to help smooth out the distortion.

#### Make the Text Look like Ink with a Smudge Tool

You can add a texture overlay for more texture and dimension to your text. To do this, click on the Text option in the Toolbox and select the dropdown that says Add Texture Overlay; this opens a new window, and you can click on your image to choose the texture.

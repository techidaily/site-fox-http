## Part 2\. Advanced Tips to Use Zoom Like a Pro

Since Zoom Meetings is being used widely, it is essential to know everything about the tool. It has been mentioned earlier that the tool is not known for its video quality, so previously we shared the ways that could be used to improve Zoom video resolution. Here, we will highlight advanced tips to use Zoom Meetings in this section.

### · Add Cool Backgrounds

Neither we nor our environment is in the form to instantly join any video conference. What could be done in such a scenario, where you have to join any video conference urgently? If you are using Zoom Meetings, you are lucky enough because you can add customized backgrounds to your video and work like a pro with Zoom.

### · Enhance Personal Space

For professional video conferences, you need to be more presentable and active. You don't have to do much to achieve what you want with Zoom Meetings. Turn on the 'Touch up Appearance.' Focus on the lighting where you are going to sit. Lastly, make sure you raise the computer to your eye level. This makes you look active and confident.

### · React with Emoji

Another tip for using Zoom Meetings like a pro is its emoji feature. With Zoom Meetings, a video conferencing tool, you can react with emojis on your screen. Even if you are muted, the emojis will speak for you on the screen.

### Bottom Line

This article is all about Zoom Meetings. The tool can be used like professionals only if you take notes from this article. We started the discussion by sharing various ways to improve the Zoom video resolution. Later we also talked about a few tips that could be adopted to get comfortable with the tool.

That being said, let's dive into a detailed review on Luminance HDR to find out more about how the tool can help users in their endeavors to create/edit HDR images

## Part 2: Review in detail on Luminance HDR

Luminance HDR software is a free tool and it offers users a simple way to create and edit HDR images efficiently. It identifies data correctly and it supports lots of decent features that users can take advantage of when executing HDR image editing or creation tasks.

In the current development after almost two years, Luminance HDR has optimized different aspects to fix bugs, enhance its speed, and lots more. Some new developments introduced include a better CLI interface, better HDPI support, automatic adjustments of LDRs levels, a new Dark theme, and fast export.

We've outlined some of the features of Luminance HDR below;

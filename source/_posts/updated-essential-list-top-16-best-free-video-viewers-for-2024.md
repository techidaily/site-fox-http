## FAQs About Windows10 Video Player

### 1\. How to Play DVDs in Windows 10 for Free?

Windows 10 doesn't have a dedicated DVD Player. Windows Media Center has been discontinued & replaced with Windows DVD Player. The app costs $15 in the Microsoft store and does not come preinstalled.

Users who upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7, or Windows 8 with Windows Media Center, are entitled to a free copy of Windows DVD Player. However, the app has many playback & compatibility issues, not to mention a large number of bugs. Free alternatives such as VLC Video Player are much better. Insert your DVD, open the VLC player, go to Media > Open Disc to watch it.

### 2\. What Is the Default Video Player for Windows 10?

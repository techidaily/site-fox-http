## Part 1\. 50 Podcast Interview Questions to Get Unique Answers

![podcast questions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-interview-questions-1.jpg)

The best way is to divide your questions into different categories.

### Great Icebreaker/Intro Questions

Icebreaker questions are used to begin an interview or meeting. These are personal questions to learn more about one another quickly. For example, the prompt might be "share your name, role, and what you usually do during the weekend." These questions aim to have fun, create points of connection between guests, and build confidence in speaking in front of the group.

## Part 2\. What's a Good Podcast Interview Question?

After discussing the 50 questions you can ask in a podcast, let's see what a good podcast interview question is. A good interview question is comfortable for the guest and engaging for the listeners, so the guest can answer the question wholeheartedly. Therefore, you need to avoid impolite and aggressive asks during podcasting. Besides, try to ask such questions that your guest is not frequently asked. It may reveal new things about him and make your podcast stand out.

## Part 3\. Tips on How To Come Up and Ask Better Questions

Asking better questions on a podcast requires preparation beforehand. Here are some tips for you to come up with better questions:

1. Write down your objectives for the interview.
2. Write down any questions about the guest or what they do that comes to your mind immediately.
3. Create a list of everything the guest does (or is interested in) in addition to their primary occupation.
4. Create a list of questions you would like to ask and learn from the speaker.

You can get the best information from the person you are interviewing if you do the following:

### Ask WHY?

![ask why](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-interview-questions-5.jpg)

As an interviewer, "why" is your most powerful tool. Guests usually provide surface-level information or opinions. The follow-up question of "why" makes them go further and give deeper details. It will also help your audience understand correctly what the guest wants to say.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### What happened next?

If your guest is overwhelmed by the emotions and has stopped before completing his answer, help him achieve it by asking, "What Happened Next?" Use a softer tone while asking this question.

### What were your feelings when this happened?

Sometimes you want the guest to answer your questions with feelings and emotions. Making your guest answer your questions while drenched in emotions can take your podcast to the next level. Questions like "What were your feelings when this happened?" can take the guest back to the past and make him answer your question with full emotions.

### Mirror your guest

Repeat the same few last words that a guest just said when he finishes his thought, and by doing that, you're creating an intonation that's sort of like a question. It's another way to permit the person you're interviewing to keep going. For example, your question might go like this. Perhaps you're asking somebody about his favorite software of the year that they've used in video editing.

He might answer like this "one of my favorite software is called [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It's a using-friendly video editing software that you can use even to do podcast shows and impressive vlogs. And I love it because I have been editing YouTube videos daily."

* You: "You've been going to edit every day?"
* The Guest: "Yeah, I've been editing videos for YouTube for over 200 days. And it's been really neat to connect with audiences there."
* You: "Connect with the audience? How?"
* The Guest: "Well, you know it's posting videos, so there's intimate interaction with people who seem to be there and watch the videos I post. And I've gotten to know many of them by name now."

So you see how this can continue to move forward by simply mirroring your guest. Try it in your following conversation, even if it's not an interview.

#### Tell me about a time when…

The best thing you can extract from someone in a podcast is their story. If you want to pull out a story from someone, phrase it like this, "Tell me about a time when..." After this question, your job is to sit back, listen, and not interrupt the guest.

## Part 4\. Podcast Questions to Avoid Asking

Avoiding asking wrong questions is as important as asking good questions. Some questions will negatively impact your podcast's quality, so avoid asking such questions. Here are some questions that you should not ask.

* Avoid asking questions that your guest is frequently asked. For example, if he appears on numerous interview podcasts and shows, he is likely often asked the same question.
* Avoid asking basic questions like, "What are you best known for?"
* Questions you anticipate will result in a "yes" should be avoided, as a simple "yes" adds little value to the interview for those listening.
* Similarly, avoid asking questions to which you can predict the answer will be a "no."
* Avoid questions that might offend your guest.

## Part 5\. Should I Send an Advance Interview Questions Podcast?

Yes, you can send interview questions to guests. Therefore, they get time to prepare interesting responses. Also, they may think about their answers or type out lengthy responses. Either way, they'll feel more comfortable and help you make better content.

## Take Your Content to the Next Level and Gets Shared

A podcast is only as good as the questions being asked. By carefully choosing which questions to ask and which to avoid, you can take your content to the next level. It also enhances the interest of listeners.

Consider the following when picking which of the above questions to use on your show: will it let your guest reveal something about who they are, how they think, or what they know will benefit your audience? If so, you are most likely on the right path! Make your podcast worth listening to get more views and shares.

## Part 4\. Advantages and Disadvantages of KineMaster App for Android

We can sum up the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on the practical process we described earlier.

### **Advantages:**

**Professional editing tools:**

KineMaster has more advanced and professional editing tools than any other mobile video editing application, such as Chroma key, special effects, filters, unique video transitions, etc. That is why prominent content creators have also used this application to edit their videos on mobile.

**Best Export Quality:**

Using KineMaster, you can export your videos in almost all the resolutions you want. Like QHD, FHD, HD, or SD, even if you are using its free version, which most mobile video editing applications do not allow in their free versions.

### **Disadvantages:**

**Premium features:**

However, KineMaster has the best video editing features, but they are not entirely free. To unlock some special effects and filters, stickers, clip graphics, transitions, etc., you must buy their premium version.

**Watermark:**

If you are a free user of it, you have to bear their watermark on your exported videos, which may affect the quality and the looks of your videos. However, using the RevDl website, you can download its apk mod, using which you can export your videos without a watermark.

## Part 6\. The best KineMaster App Alternative on Desktop

Although you can also use the KineMaster app on a desktop by following the instructions above, it can still not compete with any desktop video editor as they have much more powerful and advanced editing tools. So, it's better to use any of its alternatives on the desktop instead of using it.

So, the question now is: Which of its desktop alternatives is the best? It's called [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Considering that it offers a number of cutting-edge features that KineMaster is missing as well. Including motion tracking, keyframing, speed ramping, auto beat sync, Boris FX, NewBlue FX, and many more. Also, its export quality is highly better than KineMaster's as well.

## Conclusion

So, in the end, today's article concludes that KineMaster is undoubtedly one of the best video editing apps available for mobile devices. But if we come to the desktop, it does not look good enough to compete with any desktop editing software as it is made especially for mobile devices. So if you are a desktop user, you should use any of its alternative on a desktop like Wondershare Filmora, which have all the advanced and professional features you want to have in your desktop video editor.

## Whispering Wonders for Zzz's: Choice Vocalists

What is ASMR, and **why does ASMR make you sleepy**? Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) sufferers report the sensation as extremely calming, with a static feeling over the head, back of the neck, shoulders, and sometimes elsewhere in the body. People have likened it and connected it to the frisson or shivers many experiences while listening to music. On the other hand, ASMR is elicited by crisp or quiet noises, either alone or in combination with conservative movement or personal attention. Some ASMR-inducing films incorporate visual clues, which seem to influence the reactions of some individuals.

Whether you've used ASMR to help you sleep in the past or you love its potential advantages, it's worth researching how it works and the best **ASMR for sleep**.

## Part 1: Why does ASMR help you sleep?

Due to the recent discovery of **ASMR sleep videos**, research into its mechanism is still in its infancy. Researchers have assumptions about how ASMR works, and the conducted research gives fascinating data.

Researchers did [fMRI brain scans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6209833/) on participants experiencing ASMR in one investigation. During the ASMR tingle, participants in the research demonstrated activity across their brains, known as whole brain activation. There was also intense activity in the brain region involved with self-awareness, social comprehension, and social movements in nonhuman primates, including grooming behaviors. Because the effects of **ASMR for sleep** are comparable to those of social grooming in monkeys, the researchers hypothesized that it might be a grooming response that survived evolution.

So, **does ASMR help you sleep**? Let us find the answer in the subsequent paragraphs.

ASMR is a social reaction, which explains why it increases feelings of comfort, relaxation, and drowsiness. ASMR engages brain parts connected with chemicals such as dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins, which may boost these experiences. It may also explain why some personality traits, particularly openness to new experiences, seem to enhance the likelihood of someone having ASMR.

ASMR, on the other hand, maybe more sophisticated than this idea predicts. While most individuals who experience ASMR find it calming, it also tends to cause heightened excitement and non-sexual physiological arousal. Nostalgia is a complicated experience that could be both pleasant and sad, and ASMR may be a complex reaction that is both relaxing and exciting. ASMR links with brain connectivity. According to one research, persons with it have diminished functional connectivity or a typical connection in particular brain parts.

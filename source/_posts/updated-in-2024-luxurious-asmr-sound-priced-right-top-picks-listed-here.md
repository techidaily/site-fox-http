![sennheiser mkh416](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/asmr-microphones-7.jpg)

Sennheiser is another professional microphone committed to capturing quality ASMR recordings. Although very costly, this microphone holds several incredible features that make it worth your investment. Sennheiser MKH416 has a built-in laser beam focus- a feature that lets the mic capture only your voice and rejects every other ambient sound. Connecting Sennheiser to an audio recording source requires an XLR cable and a phantom power source. This voice aid offers great services.

## Part 2\. What Else Do You Need to Make Good ASMR Videos?

2. Gentle whispering
3. Scratching
4. Tapping
5. Crinkling
6. Humming

8. Buzzing
9. Chewing
10. Water drops

* **An absolute quiet recording environment**

When creating an ASMR clip, you need perfect decorum for you to achieve your aim. If your environment doesn't support such, then you need top-quality sound editing software that detects and deletes background noise without data loss. Which software supports such services? Find out below.

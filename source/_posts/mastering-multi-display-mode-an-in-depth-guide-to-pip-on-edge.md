## Mastering Multi-Display Mode: An In-Depth Guide to PIP on Edge

Picture-in-Picture is an important feature on Windows and Android computers. It allows you to watch videos while they float on the screen of your desktop or smartphone. Microsoft Edge has PIP on Android and all other platforms to enable you to float videos on your screen on mini mode. And you can watch them as you perform other tasks on different apps and programs.

## Part 1\. How to Enable and Disable Picture in Picture in Edge

To exploit the PIP mode on your desktop computer, there are simple steps to follow to achieve this. And once you are in PIP mode, you can turn it off at your convenience.

### Turn on PIP

You can turn on PIP on Microsoft Edge using four different methods.

1. Using PIP Button
2. By Using Global Media Control
3. By installing Picture in Picture Extension on Microsoft Edge
4. Right-click on a playing video

I will discuss two of the methods: Using the PiP Button and Right-click on the Video.

To enable PiP in edge on your desktop computer using the button, there are cheap 5 steps to follow right here.

1. Start Microsoft Edge on your PC and click the **3 dots** in the top right corner
2. Go to **Settings > Cookies and Site Permissions**
3. Go to **Picture in Picture Control**
4. Go to **Show Picture in Picture Control inside Video Frame** and turn on the button.

You can drag and move the floating window around the screen and drop it at any location that you want with your mouse. And you can also resize that video so that it gives you a large space to proceed with other activities.

### Turn off PIP

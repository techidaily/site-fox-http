## Part 5\. How to transcribe Voice Memos to text?

Do you still type to organize meeting minutes or song lyrics after you have recorded them using Voice Memos? This requires a lot of effort and takes a lot of time. Being able to directly convert voice to text will significantly increase your productivity. Here we have introduced useful methods on 3 platforms to transcribe voice to text.

### On iPhone

**[Transcribe - Speech to Text](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transcribe-speech-to-text/id1241342461?platform=iphone)**

Transcribe – Speech to text is one of the best apps to convert your voice into text using an iPhone. It offers excellent AI conversion with easy-to-use interface.

**[Rev Voice Recorder & Memos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/revvoicerecorder/id598332111?referrer=click%3Dde4d5f16-b9cd-44de-a19a-e2bb29ee0aae?platform=iphone)**

Rev Voice Recorder & Memos is another app that iPhone users can use to transcribe their memos into text. Unlike Transcribe – Speech to Text, the Rev is not only an excellent transcribing tool but also a great tool for recording audio with good features.

**[Just Press Record](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/just-press-record/id1033342465?platform=iphone)**

Although being a paid program, it operates easily and has a simpler user interface. In addition to the accurate conversion feature, the program also allows for immediate recording and iCloud syncing.

**[Dictation - Speech to text](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dictation-speech-to-text/id1124772331)**

Instead of typing, you can speak your content directly. There is no time limit for dictation. Voice Memos can be translated into any language and converted to text by Dictation – Speech to text.

### On Mac

These are the most effective ways to transcribe your voice recordings into text on Mac:

**[Dictation](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/mac-help/mh40584/mac)**

Dictation is a built-in function that transcribes your Voice Memos to text on Mac. It is easy to use and accurately converts audio to text.

**[Rev Voice Recorder & Memos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/revvoicerecorder/id598332111?referrer=click%3Dde4d5f16-b9cd-44de-a19a-e2bb29ee0aae?platform=iphone)**

This software is also available to convert audio into text on Mac devices. Rev Voice recorder offers good transcribing and recording features on your Mac.

**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

Wondershare Filmora can also help you to transcribe your Voice Memos into text. Filmora's [Speech to Text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) feature will provide you with the best results. Just add your Voice Memos and select the speech-to-text option. It will auto-generate text more accurately and in less time than any other software.

**[Dictation - Speech to text](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dictation-speech-to-text/id1124772331)**

Dictation Speech to text is also available for Mac devices. It works the same as in the iPhone to convert Voice Memos into text.

### Online

These online websites will help you in converting your Voice Memos into text:

VEED.IO is an online converting website that can help you convert your audio to text within minutes. It is the best option for you to convert your Voice Memos into text online.

**[Rev Voice Recorder & Memos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/revvoicerecorder/id598332111?referrer=click%3Dde4d5f16-b9cd-44de-a19a-e2bb29ee0aae?platform=iphone)**

Rev is also available to transcribe audio into text online. Visit the Rev Website and then upload your Voice Memos to convert it into text.

**[Otranscribe](https://otranscribe.com/)**

Otranscribe is one of the best online tools to transcribe Voice Memos into text. It stands out because it's free to use, unlike other websites offering trial and purchase. It is entirely free to use and user-friendly.

## FAQ

### 1\. Can Voice Memos record phone calls?

However, there is no exact feature available in the iPhone Voice Memos to do it, but one trick that can help you in this regard is that you start the call and turn on the speaker. Now pick up another iPhone and begin recording a Voice Memos on it. You can record your call using a Voice Memos in this way.

You can easily record audio and send it via mail or a voice message on WhatsApp. You can also convert these Voice Memos into text using transcription tools available for iPhone, Mac, and Online.

Step1 First, download its latest version. Next, launch the software, and click **“Import”** on the main dashboard to add two songs to make a custom ringtone for your iPhone.

Step2 Drag the songs to the **“Timeline Panel”** at the bottom. Then, right-click only that song whose silent parts you want to eliminate.

**_P.S.:_** Audio Ducking can automatically lower the volume of one track to make another track clearer when you're recording voiceovers, narrations, translations, podcasts, YouTube videos, and other productions that benefit from lowering background music under speech.

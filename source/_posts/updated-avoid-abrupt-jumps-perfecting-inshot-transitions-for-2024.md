With lots of sound effects and voice-overs, the InShot video editor changed the market's outlook for different video makers.

InShot makes it easier to sync text and emoji as the video advances while introducing unique timeline features. The tremendous cinematic effects have brought a revolution to the market multifold.

While we add transitions to the videos, InShot gives the user a shot of the Mosaic tool, one of the new features brought to the table. The new effect pack "Retro2" brings old school impression to the video. The different cut-out videos are smoothly featured with transitions.

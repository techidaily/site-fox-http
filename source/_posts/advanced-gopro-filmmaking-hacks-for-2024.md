If you are new to GoPro models then it will be little difficult to take benefit from all stunning features of these devices. Hence to create impressive videos, it is good to follow few expert tips and tricks.

## Tips and Tricks for GoPro

#### 1.Settings

 You can leave most of the GoPro settings on Auto mode so that your action camera can manage brainy stuff during recording. If you want to follow the customized settings then it is better to go ahead with low light settings or white balance etc. Depending upon your footage needs, you can vary the resolution levels between WVGA and 4K whereas the perfect middle ground for all your needs is 1080p level. With few basic settings for brightness and exposure you can easily develop rich footage.

#### 2.Choose the Right GoPro Mounts:

 You will be glad to know that GoPro action camera users can have incredible mount selection options. They can be easily fixed on handlebars, heads and surfboards or even on your pets. The high quality mounts will always keep your device safe and ensure stabilized recording with perfect shooting angle adjustments. The helmet mounts assist users in perfect POV adjustment whereas the chest harness is essential if you need much stable footage. Most of GoPro devices come with mounts in their boxes whereas you can also buy them as additional accessories.

#### 3.Try Protune

 If you have high end camera like Hero3, Hero4 or Hero5 then you are lucky enough to enjoy one advanced feature named as Protune. This is really an impressive tool but users must be well trained to use it effectively. With this feature you can make easy adjustments for exposure levels, white balance and ISO speeds. You can find this setting under capture setting option of your device but if you are working with default arrangements then it will lead to washed out look with grainy appearance.

#### 4.Change Perspective

 The GoPro action cameras are well known for wide angle lenses but it doesn’t mean that you must keep on shooting all videos with 170 degree FOV. It is better to switch between different field of angles at different time instants as per need of your footage. You can switch to 90 degree that is narrow view whereas 127 degrees is rated as a medium view. The narrower settings help users to get more focused look of action or in other words it works somewhat like zooming in. You can find FOV settings on the screen itself under main video settings.

#### 5.Use Timelapse Mode

 Almost all GoPro models possess advanced time lapse mode that assists in perfect shooting of city streets as well as sports games. It is not essential to stick to the slow motion mode all the time rather you can do more adventurous things with your camera. The time lapse mode selection is available over on-board settings and it assists users in capturing individual photos.

#### 6.Make use of fisheye lens

 The wide angle lenses of your camera can serve you for capturing impressive fish eye photographs. The best news is that fisheye lenses provide amazing results for selfies as they capture backgrounds with stunning view. With this feature, you can take beautiful shots even at your arm’s length.

#### 8.Carry Extra Batteries:

You know there is nothing bad than finding your GoPro batteries running down at the time of most beautiful shoots. GoPro itself use to serve branded chargers and spare batteries that you can use without any trouble.

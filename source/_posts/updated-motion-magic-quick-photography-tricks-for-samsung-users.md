## Motion Magic: Quick Photography Tricks for Samsung Users

Samsung mobile device users can capture different types of videos easily. There are different video shooting modes available. You can choose from super slow-motion, timelapse, and even hyper-lapse. Timelapse is capturing a fixed frame multiple times at regular intervals. Thereafter, the captured frames are compiled in a short video form. The frame rate is set low and the phone camera stays fixed at its position.

On the other hand, a hyper-lapse is a timelapse where the camera moves. You must have come across videos where timelapse plays for a few seconds. You must have noticed how the timelapse transforms the entire video content immensely. You can accomplish the same with your Samsung time lapse and hyper-lapse feature. We will illustrate how to create timelapse video on Samsung mobile devices.

## Part 1\. How to Make a Timelapse Video on Samsung

Suppose you want to shoot a video of the sunrise or sunset. If you shoot in the regular video mode, the video length will be long. When you play the video, the changes in the movement of the sun will be super slow. That is where timelapse can do wonders. You can shoot a long video by taking photos of the scene at regular intervals.

When you play the photos in video form, it becomes a very short timelapse video. You can show an hour-long sunrise in a few minutes or seconds. You can create such a timelapse video with your Samsung phone. Here are the steps on how to do time lapse on Samsung mobile device.

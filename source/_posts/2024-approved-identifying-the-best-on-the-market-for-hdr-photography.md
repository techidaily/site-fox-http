![camera mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-6.jpg)

Most photographers prefer aperture priority mode. One reason is that you decide on the aperture and allow you camera to decide on the shutter speed, considering metering mode.

##### Step2 Metering Mode

![metering modes of camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-7.jpg)

You’ll need to decide between the evaluative/matrix (scene-based), center wieghted or spot metering modes. Choosing one entirely based on your preferences.

However, evaluative/scene-based metering mode is seen as the reliable mode in aperture priority. Because, this mode will balance and find median exposure on the given scene.

##### Step3 Aperture, ISO and Shutter

![iso](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-8.jpg)

For landscape or cityscape, an ISO of 100 is considered the best. Even in low light situation, this setting works.

A small aperture of about f/8 to f/22 is enough. However, you need to check the level of lens sharpness to get balanced photos.

Shutter speed translates to the estimated time the sensor exposes to the scene, the longer the shutter speed, the brighter your photo will be.

**Bonus Tip:**

Go for raw shooting, as raw files keep record information on the given image sensor.

##### Step4 Automatic Exposure Bracketing

![aeb setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-9.jpg)

If you’re using a DSLR/mirrorless camera, it’ll have AEB. To enable it, go to menu. You should go through the manual, as every camera has accessed the feature differently.

Once found, it’ll make you set two things; interval and bracket. Brackets will decide on the number of photos you’ll capture whereas interval keeps the gap between those photos.

##### Step5 Timer and Mirror

You can focus on these steps to reduce slightest movement, even if your camera is mounted on the tripod.

**Timer**

![timer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-10.jpg)

##### Step6 Go for One or More Bracketed Exposures

HDR photography creates noise and makes images appear grainy. To fix this, you can go for low ISO setting to ensure less noise.

### Choose Continuous Mode

![continuous mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-13.jpg)

You’ll have several options in post processing if you go for more brackets. For example, going for nine exposures will help you get a better looking image result than opting for two exposures.

### Focus on Aperture Priority Mode

![aperture priority mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-16.jpg)

This mode influences the way your camera see field depth. When you keep your aperture fixed for all photos, it’ll prevent changes in depth field. When not fixed, these changes can ruin the image.

### Get yourself a Tripod

A two-second timer sounds great as it’ll prevent you from coming in contact with your gear and avoid even the least chance of movement.

**Mirror Lockup**

![mirror lockup](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-11.jpg)

A risk of micro-vibration is present in DSLRs, especially when the mirror flips up and expose the image sensor to the light. You can use lockup feature to fix this.

Press the shutter release once, as it’ll flip up the mirror. Press is second time to open the shutter curtain and capture the photo.

##### Step6 Go for One or More Bracketed Exposures

Now you’re good to click snaps! Just press the shutter release button and listen to the sound of shutter curtains.

Lastly, go to histogram on the LCD screen and ensure each photo features the full dynamic range.

In post processing, you can opt for more than one bracketed exposures, so choose the best ones.

## Part 4: How to Make the HDR Shooting Easier

If you find it challenging to capture a great quality HDR image, following tips may help you.

### Choose Low ISO Setting

![iso setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-12.jpg)

HDR photography creates noise and makes images appear grainy. To fix this, you can go for low ISO setting to ensure less noise.

### Choose Continuous Mode

![continuous mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-13.jpg)

For shooting, choose continuous mode becasue it’ll require you to take bracketed photos only by clicking the release button once. This option is available in Canon and Nikon cameras.

### Go for a Cable Release

![cable release](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-14.jpg)

When you press the release button, chances of camera shaking or movement are high. You can try preventing it by using a cable release.

### Opt for Several Brackets

![brackets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-15.jpg)

You’ll have several options in post processing if you go for more brackets. For example, going for nine exposures will help you get a better looking image result than opting for two exposures.

### Focus on Aperture Priority Mode

![aperture priority mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/help-you-choose-the-best-hdr-cameras-in-2022-16.jpg)

This mode influences the way your camera see field depth. When you keep your aperture fixed for all photos, it’ll prevent changes in depth field. When not fixed, these changes can ruin the image.

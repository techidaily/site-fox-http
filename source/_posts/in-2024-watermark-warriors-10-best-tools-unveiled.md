#### 6. Watermark Software

#### 7. Alamoon Watermark

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

#### 8. Star Watermark

#### 10. Water Marquee

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images.

When done, simply click on the Save icon and choose the destination folder on your hard drive in which the watermarked photo is going to be stored.

**Conclusion**

There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos?

Here are two ways to add a filter on video:

● You can shoot a video with filter effect directly from a video camera filter which is quite expensive.

● Besides, you can also use a video editor with a built-in filter effect to enhance the cost-effective video performance.

However, an editor for a video filter is easier to get than buying a professional video camera filter, especially when you know video editing.

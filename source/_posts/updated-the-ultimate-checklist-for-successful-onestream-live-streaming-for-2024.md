## The Ultimate Checklist for Successful OneStream Live Streaming

Live streaming has become the recent trend among content creators as study shows that people engage more in live streams than written posts and regular video uploads. However, pulling off a successful live stream is quite challenging. You will have to get your script correct at the go, there are audio problems, and network issues are not ruled out. Where it all gets messed up is that you can't edit if you make mistakes or an issue can slightly disrupt your stream. So, you have to be extra careful to do it successfully.

Fortunately, with the OneStream live streaming tool, you may not need to worry much because you can successfully and efficiently live stream a pre-recorded video. So, after recording your video and editing it to your taste, you can use OneStream to stream it as a live video to any social platform.

## Part 1\. What is OneStream Live?

[OneStream](https://onestream.live/) Live is a cloud-based live streaming tool that allows you to stream your pre-recorded videos as live videos over any external website. You can simultaneously live stream to over 40 social networks, including Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, etc. You can also go live (not pre-recorded video) using OneStream.

You also don't have to worry about the requirements of the social platform you are streaming to. OneStream will take care of everything.

**Price:** Although there is a free trial, you must subscribe to a plan to enjoy most of the exciting features of OneStream because the free version comes with minimal features.

* Free Plan - $0/month (5min max and one social account option). You can use this to explore the tool a little bit before making a financial commitment.
* Basic Plan - $10/month. 15 mins max & 3 social accounts
* Standard Plan - $45/month. 60 mins max & 25 social accounts
* Professional Plan - $99/month. 8hrs max & 50 social accounts

## Part 2\. Key features of OneStream Live

**Embed Player:** with OneStream, you can live stream on your external website. You have to embed your live stream on your website.

**Live Spaces:** if you don't have a webpage, you don't need to worry because OneStream has covered you. The live space feature allows you to create your webpage with a few clicks.

**Schedule Streaming:** This tool allows you to schedule what time your pre-recorded video will live stream to your audience. So, if you are not going to be available at the time your want to live stream, you can schedule your video to live stream by itself when that time comes. Live streams can be scheduled up to 60 days in advance.

**Live Stream Playlist:** so basically, this feature allows you to Queue up your scheduled pre-recorded videos in the desired order you want them you go live.

**Caption:** You can add a caption to your pre-recorded live stream through SRT files.

**Brand Your Streams:** You can add customized logos, watermarks, and thumbnails to personalize your streams. This feature will come in handy if you have a brand you want to build.

**Your Stream Analytics: W**ith OneStream, you can see how your audience interacts with your streams. It is crucial to know how well your streams are doing. You can view all your social platform analytics on your OneStream dashboard.

**180- and 360-Degrees Video Support:** OneStream streaming tool allows you to go live with 360- and 180-degrees videos.

## Part 3\. How to live stream with Online OneStream

Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.

Step1 First, head to [OneStream live website](https://app.onestream.live/signup) and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.

Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can't see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.

To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account's Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.

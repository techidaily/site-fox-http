![iColorama S photo editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icolorama-s-photo-editor-brush-painter.jpg)

You can import photos into Clip Studio Paint and paint over them or use the Pose Scanner feature to create automatic poses. However, creating high-resolution images with Clip Studio Paint on older versions of the iPhone may be difficult and you must have iPhone Pro Max or some similar model in order to produce artwork in high resolutions.

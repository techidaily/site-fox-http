To know more about the importance of the Podcast trailer, we have to look into the following things:

A podcast trailer is a teaser that introduces your audio or video podcast to the listeners. It can consist of some key features of your podcast with voice. Before they even start listening, it helps listeners get a sense of your podcast.

### Why is it necessary?

A podcast trailer is fundamental in attracting the audience to watch the full podcast. It can help you highlight your podcast's key points and why it stands the best.

## Part 2\. How to make a good podcast trailer? 5 Tips for it

With the high demand for video consumption across the world, video editing has become a necessary task for most users. Even persons with general needs such as classes, presentations, meetings, etc. would need a video editor to complete their video project. A

After Effects is one of the most promising video editing applications available in the market. It facilitates its users with many editing features. One of such major functions of After Effects is it provides different fonts and text effects to its users. Here's a guide on **how to add fonts to After Effects**:

## Part 1\. How to add fonts to After Effects?

Adding fonts to any video editor is a crucial part because texts add a story to the video projects. They have a great impact on the cinematic quality of any video. For informative videos, the style of font decides the tone in which the texts are displayed.

Thus, selecting a proper font for the video becomes necessary in the post-production process. In the After Effects application, there are different fonts available for the users to load and use in any video. And if you are wondering **how to add font in After effects** to your video, then you can follow these steps:

* For adding the Adobe Fonts to After Effects, you will first need to enable them by signing in to the Creative Cloud application on your desktop. To do that, first, open the Creative Cloud, navigate to Assets, and click on Fonts.

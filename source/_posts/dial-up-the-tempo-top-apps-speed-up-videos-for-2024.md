## Dial Up the Tempo: Top Apps Speed Up Videos

In video playback, how the content plays out and the playback's speed determines content quality. Many editors add slow-motion effects to videos or parts to create a stylish and top-notch look.

However, this effect becomes a default in the videos after adding it, and users cannot easily deactivate the setting. It can get annoying to deal with when you are trying to play a video, but it starts automatically playing in slow-motion on your video player.

1. **Why do my videos play automatically in slow motion?**

If a video was created with a slow-motion effect, the recorded video would automatically play in slow motion when you play it in another video player. It is important to manually change the settings or adjust the video speed directly.

1. **How do I record a slow-motion video on my Android phone?**

It is possible to record videos in slow-motion on Android phones using the editor app you are using. There are no preset speed customization settings in Android smartphones for video speed. So, you have to download and use a compatible video editing app for the function.

1. **How can I convert my slow-motion video to better quality?**

You can use different tools to convert a slow-motion video to a higher speed. The best software for that is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), with strong and multi-level video editing functions. You can import the video, click the speed icon, choose the video section to edit using the slide, and increase speed to level 100.0.

For a more detailed understanding, you can refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBF1xTx7hBk).

## Conclusion

It isn't easy to directly adjust your recorded video speed on Android smartphones and tablets if it is set as that. Instead, you can download one of the list apps on your device to correctly change your video speed.

Depending on your app, like Filmora, you can choose the video section to adjust speed if slow motion is available in select scenes. Multiple apps come with varying speed range choices and speed ramping support.

It would help if you tried them all out before settling on the best one suited for your needs.

### Can I add affiliate links on Reddit?

This can be a delicate subject when it comes to Reddit. Especially for a new account. Try to get at least 500 karma points and age your account a few months before posting affiliate links on Reddit. Also, do not spam them or you will get banned.

### Can you get paid directly by Reddit?

No, Reddit doesn't pay its members for using the platform. It's just a place where users can meet, talk, and do business. You can find jobs that pay through Reddit but need help getting paid by Reddit.

## Conclusion

Reddit offers endless opportunities to make money online. Unfortunately, it takes time to find the right subreddit to join. But if you keep digging and trying out new things, you'll find something you love and get paid for it.

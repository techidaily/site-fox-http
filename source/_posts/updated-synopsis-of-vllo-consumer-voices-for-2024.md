Moreover, there is no built-in camera within the app, and most of the filters, music, stickers, effects, and other advanced tools are available only for premium users.

## Part 5\. Best VLLO Video Editor Alternative on Desktop

Unfortunately, mobile devices don't have the same processing power as desktop computers. This is why desktop video editing software is better, as it can handle more complex tasks and create better results. Mobile video editing apps are often more limited in features and functionality. They also tend to be more difficult to use since the smaller screen size makes it harder to see the details of your work.

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a video editing app that gives users the power to create and edit professional-quality videos with ease. The software comes with all the tools you need to make your videos look their best, including a timeline editor, transitions, effects, and more.

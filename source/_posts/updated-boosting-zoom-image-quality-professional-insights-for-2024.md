### Bottom Line

We started the discussion by sharing various ways to improve the Zoom video resolution. Later we also talked about a few tips that could be adopted to get comfortable with the tool.

02 [Advanced Tips to Use Zoom Like a Pro](#part2)

## Part 1\. Step by Step Guide to Help You Improve Zoom Video Quality

[Zoom Meetings](https://zoom.us/) is a top-rated tool widely used for video conferencing. As mentioned earlier, the Pandemic era was the hardest time; many changes took place. One great change was that schools, offices, and universities were being managed from home. Zoom Meetings were the most popular medium to communicate and work during this tough time.

Although the tool is very famous for its services, it has never been known for its video quality. If you want to improve the video quality and Zoom recording resolution, keep reading; this section will share various methods.

### 1\. Low Light Adjustment

As we said earlier that Zoom is known for its video conferencing but not its video quality. People don't know that the video quality could be improved from within Zoom Meetings. The number 1 way is to enable its Low Light Adjustments.

With this setting feature, your video quality remains balanced even if you don’t have enough light. By using this software optimization technique, Zoom Meetings automatically brightens your videos. Follow the steps shared below to enable this setting feature.

### Step 1: Open Video Settings Tab

To enable Low Light Adjustment, first of all, click on your Zoom profile picture and then select the 'Settings' option. From the Settings menu list, go for the option of 'Video.'

![open zoom settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/improve-video-quality-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Enable the Low Light Setting

First, from the Video section, look for the ‘Adjust for Low Light’ option. Toggle on this option, and then Zoom Meetings will spontaneously adjust the low light settings.

### Step 3: Manual Settings

You can also set the Low Light settings manually. For this, you have to select the 'Manual' option from the toggle button. A manual slider will show up on the screen to set the brightness.

## Unlocking Value for Vendors and Viewers Through YouTuber Sponsorship

If you are just starting your channel, don't expect someone to sponsor the channel right away, you need to create ways for the sponsor to come to you because now a days YouTube creators are becoming valuable assets to brands. Subscriber trust creator's opinions and can learn about new products in just a few minutes. Branded content and sponsored video are a great way to make additional revenue from your YouTube sponsor and grow your YouTube channel. As long as you have an engaged audience, its possible to secure sponsored content opportunities on YouTube.

Most content creator rely on sponsorship to make money from YouTube these days. The good news is that even if you have small channel this is still an option that's available to you.

In this article, we'll tell you exactly how to get sponsored on YouTube.

## What is Sponsored video

Product sponsorship are when a brand sends you a free product to review. Product reviews are often the first sponsorship type a creator experience. Paid sponsorships are the highest level of YouTube sponsorship, you promote product or service on your channel in exchange for payment. They're more likely to come your way once you've started to grow your channel.

Youtubers collaborate or accept sponsorship with the brand that fit their channel genre and personal interest so the sponsored videos resonate with their subscriber and target audience.

## Ways to Have Sponsored Product

### Focus on your content

Given that you created now your YouTube channel, make sure to make a video that focus on what your niche or content. Think about what companies and products would be the most relevant, enjoyable, and valuable to your viewers. Example you like to talk about skin care products. Make sure that at least your first 10 videos focus about skin care. Or maybe make a video that relatable to everyone, but if you want products sponsorships do some products review on your channel. You will find your target audience if your consistent on the video you are creating. Products sponsors may come your way if you are consistent even if you have small audience or subscribers.

### Invest in your video

I personally, before the brand noticed my channel, i invested in products that i will review on my channel. I buy to try and do a review because i know someday this brand will noticed or watch my video and in this way i also got a chance to practice my speaking skills in front of the camera. If you are just starting this career, no one will come right away to sponsor you, so you need to make a way to get noticed and this is one way for you to be able to have a product sponsorship.

Essentially, you should think of your channel as your portfolio that brands will see before deciding to collaborate. The more professional your channel looks, the more opportunities you could have.

Don't rush everything or you're get tired right away. the first thing you have to do is make a hard effort to create quality content so that your channel will stand out from others. Remember there are a lot of content creator doing the same products review. The only thing you will do is make your own style and make sure you're not copying others.

### Reach out to Brands

The best way to get a sponsorship, especially for products reviewing, is by reaching out to the brands.

You can make an email and send it to the target brand but make sure you created a personalized email. Always do research about the brand and if possible, create a video that you are using or reviewing their products. Some brands are more likely to offer a sponsorship to creator who are using their products.

Make a sponsorship proposal to offer a business with the brand, include in the letter the benefits of the brand on sponsoring on you channel, give them the positive output and an eagerness that you can help them increase their sales by doing a product review on your channel. But make sure that all Brand you're reaching out is the brand you tried and tested. Don't ever collaborate to the brand that you don't like to.

You should already have several videos on your channel before you approach brands, and it's important to demonstrate that you have a consistent posting schedule. Brand want to get their products and services in front of potential buyers, so you'll need to show that your videos have views.

### Contact Information

Don't forget to always put your contact information in each of your video, you can use the description box to put your contact details like your, email address, Facebook account page, Instagram account where they can direct message you and your other social media. Just put all information where brand can contact you in case, they want to offer you a products collaboration or sponsorships. Often

### Make Stand out Video

There is brand that watch the videos of their target content creator, especially when you email them about sponsorships, they watch your video first before doing business with you. That is why It is essential that you create a high-quality video that will attract more sponsorship.

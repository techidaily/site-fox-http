## Part 1: Things to Consider When Buying a Monitor for Mac

#### Section 1.Ports

There are two common options for connectivity, either you can access thunderbolt or go for HDMI cables. The ThunderBolt connectivity option gives you two connection abilities, either you can try the first generation system or go for advanced 2nd and 3rd generation. Each one of these have different capabilities. The Thunderbolt 1 offers easy connection with DisplayPort 1.1 a and allows maximum video throughput of 8.64 GBPS. ThunderBolt 2 can handle Display Port 1.2 with maximum video throughput ranging up to 17.28 GBPS. Third option is ThunderBolt 3 that has ability to work with 40GBPS throughput.

HDMI ports also assist in easy connectivity with MacBook Pro, Mac mini and Mac Pro models. Most of the latest Mac units are designed with HDMI 1.4 connectivity option that can handle 4K Display and Ultra HD Display at 24Hz and 30Hz rating respectively. On the other side, HDMI 2.0 offers 4K display connectivity while handling 60 Hz output.

#### Section 2.4K Supported Macs

It is possible to connect external monitors with most of Mac Computers. You can easily transfer details between 4K Ultra HD TV and 4K Monitors. Here is the top compatibility list:

* MacBook-Retina, 12”.
* iMac, 27”.
* Mac Pro
* Mac Mini
* MacBook Air and
* MacBook Pro

It is also possible to make connections via HDMI cable with supported resolution level of 3840 by 2160 and 4096 by 2160 at 30Hz and 24 Hz respectively.

#### Section 3.Single Stream (SST) Displays and Multi Stream Transport (MST) Displays

The 4K resolution with 60Hz range is often managed with Multi-Stream Transport technology because this method helps to combine two halves impressively on single larger surface. On the other side with Single Stream Transport option there is no need for stitching. For gamers, it is much better to go ahead with SST technology as it can better handle 4K details with 60Hz range.

## How Popular Is PUBG?

PUBG, previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, is an online player versus player (PvP) shooter game that allows up to 100 players to fight against each other in a battle royal.

Battle royale is a type of large-scale LMS (last man standing deathmatch), where each player fight to be the last one alive. PUBG Studios, which is a subsidiary of Krafton, is the developer and publisher of this online multiplayer battle royale game.

In the game, players can enter the match with a team of up to 4 people, solo or duo. The last team or person alive is the winner. Each match begins with players parachuting from an airplane onto one of the game's eight maps.

Since its release in 2017, PUBG has become one of the most popular video games on Steam, with more than 500k peak concurrent players recorded every month. Its all-time peak was in January 2018, when it recorded 3.24 million players.

After its release, the game gained a loyal legion of fans within a short period, with most of the players being young people. By July 2020, cumulative unit sales of PUBG had hit 70 million. The game won the 2017 Best Multiplayer Game held at The Game Awards.

It's also free to play the mobile version for iOS and Android, released in 2018\. What's more? The mobile version was nominated for the Best Mobile Game at The Game Awards in 2018\. PUBG is also popular among youths because it allows them to interact with audience members before action.

Additionally, many youths love PUBG because it has engaging gameplay that forces them to think and act fast. Every decision the player makes has a massive impact on the game's outcome and their chances of survival.

Players have to set priorities and scavenge for resources. They also have to master the art of balancing stealth and aggression while being surrounded by other players who want to kill them.

##### Step5Customize Your Thumbnail

Choose the filter effect you like, then drag and drop it on top of the thumbnail in your timeline.

To add text to your thumbnail, go to the Title tab. You'll see loads of built-in presets for titles. Choose the title pack you want and drag and drop it to your thumbnail in the timeline. You can also right-click on the title and select Apply to add the effect to the timeline.

Move the title where you want it to appear on your thumbnail, and adjust your text accordingly to suit your montage video. You can change the font size, color, and style. Filmora allows you to install fonts. Keep in mind that big text stands out on mobile devices. You can also add a border or shadow to your text to make it more eye-catching.

You can right-click on the thumbnail in your media library and select the reveal in Explorer to find where it's saved.

At just under $450 on Amazon, this 28-inch Ultra HD monitor gives gamers a top-notch visual experience, impressive calibration options and the ability to work with some of the more powerful graphic cards on the market.</p><p> Affordability was always a major sticking point for 4k UHD monitors. Like its peers, this ASUS product fills a gap in the market and provides a much-improved gaming experience to gamers on a budget. Its 3840 x 2160px resolution makes for a great widescreen view that’s perfect for the sweeping panoramic scenes and epic scales that make video gaming so much fun today.</p><h2 id="ASUS-MG28UQ-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#ASUS-MG28UQ-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="ASUS MG28UQ 4K Monitor Pros and Cons"></a>ASUS MG28UQ 4K Monitor Pros and Cons</h2><p> The ASUS MG28UQ monitor has many great features worth highlighting. For starters, it comes with a TN Liquid Crystal Display screen that boasts an excellent 1ms response rate. It gets even better. This monitor also has AMD FreeSync. At its peak refresh rate, it provides consistently tear-free visuals when paired with compatible graphics cards.</p><p> It also sports a sturdy, fully adjustable stand that can support the monitor in landscape or portrait mode. With its VESA mount, gamers who prefer to mount their monitors on a wall can do so comfortably. And where multiple monitors are needed, the ASUS MG28UQ has visual alignment cues (arrows) that help ensure images display correctly across all screens.</p><p> On the downside however, the quality of imagery on this monitor drops significantly when it’s viewed from side angles. There’s also diminished image contrast when screen brightness is set to maximum. These issues can affect gaming experience where multiple players and viewers are involved. That said, these problems are typical for TN LCD screens which on the upside, have the fastest response rate of most LCD screens on the market today. That’s exactly why they’re perfect for gaming. Many gamers would agree that trading image quality at obscure angles for a synced, tear-free video experience is a fair compromise.</p><p> Another significant downside to this otherwise fantastic gaming monitor is its 60Hz peak refresh rate while in 4k UHD mode. The fact is that hardcore gaming increasingly requires a 144Hz refresh rate and gamers who play at this high refresh rate experience a significant drop in the quality of video gaming at lesser rates. While this 4k UHD monitor can perform at 144Hz theoretically, it’s unable to do so in reality due to the limited bandwidth of its input ports.</p><p> While this shortfall is significant, it is also true that the majority of average gamers use systems whose graphic cards can do no better than 60Hz. This means that for many average gamers, this monitor’s 60Hz limit is not a very serious problem.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Design"><a href="#Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Design"></a>Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The ASUS MG28UQ monitor has a sleek and unobtrusive design that’s somewhat different from what you get with flashier gaming monitors. It has even, wide bezels that frame its display without distracting from the screen. It also has a subtle black matte finish that’s bound to appeal to gamers who like minimalist design.</p><p> Its stand is a very critical component of this monitor’s functionality. It is designed to allow the screen to tilt outwards by up to 20 degrees, swivel right and left by 60 degrees, and pivot 90 degrees from landscape to portrait mode. Its 5.9-inch stand is also height adjustable. That’s a good deal of flexibility for a monitor that’s at the affordable end of the price spectrum.</p><p> The ASUS MG28UQ is also VESA compatible. This simply means that it has a standardized apparatus for mounting it safely on a wall. VESA compatibility guarantees that the mount is sufficient for the weight and size of the monitor. The importance of this feature cannot be overstated as inadequate wall mounts can prove very costly indeed.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-ports.jpg"                      alt="asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-ports"                ></p><p> It’s hard to fault the ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor for input connectivity since it features a total of 8 input ports. It includes one HDMI 2.0 port, two HDMI 1.4 ports, one DisplayPort 1.2, three USB 3.0 ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This monitor has enough connectivity options to support robust gaming data transfer as well as external media devices like a keyboard, mouse, camera and smartphone. Along with its AMD FreeSync technology, this monitor is built to support a fully-equipped game station for optimal gaming performance.</p><p> It’s also great that while the input panel is located at the lowest side of the monitor, it can easily be reached by pivoting the monitor towards portrait mode. Most non-pivot monitors that have theirs similarly placed can be a hassle to set up. To reach their input panels, gamers must bend themselves uncomfortably or worse, upset the balance of their monitors by tilting them dangerously outward. With its effective pivoting stand, the ASUS MG28UQ is quite easy to set up and use.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-OSD-and-Settings"><a href="#1-OSD-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1.OSD and Settings"></a>1.OSD and Settings</h4><p> This monitor’s On-Screen Menu is accessed through a 5-way joystick located at the back of the monitor. It comes with multiple picture presets such as Racing mode which happens to be its default picture setting.</p><p> In addition to the usual image adjustment menus like brightness, contrast and color temperature, the ASUS MG28UQ monitor also has easy-to-use control menus for its TraceFree and VividPixel technologies, designed to minimize ghosting and boost clarity. Its AMD FreeSync feature, which is active only for DisplayPort inputs, can also be adjusted through the OSD menu.</p><p> GamePlus Technology is a proprietary feature that can also be activated through the OSD. It lets gamers display timers, FPS counters and custom crosshairs for better aiming accuracy.</p><h4 id="2-Color-Performance"><a href="#2-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Color Performance"></a>2.Color Performance</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-color-accuracy.jpg"                      alt="asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-color-accuracy"                ></p><p> Eye strain is a problem most users experience after hours of non-stop gaming. It helps to have a monitor that can reduce eye strain and improve user comfort. The ASUS MG28UQ monitor is a great choice in this regard. It has an effective Glare Filter as well as Blue Light Reduction and Flicker-Free technologies that mean it can be used comfortably in daylight.</p><p> Despite its ease on the eyes, color management is one area where this monitor is found wanting. The ASUS MG28UQ monitor can display only 96 – 97% of the sRGB color gamut and under 80% of Adobe’s robust RGB gamut. This is significant because color accuracy is very important for professional visual designers who also tend to use 4K UHD monitors. This limitation with color display all but ensures that the ASUS MG28UQ monitor is best used exclusively for gaming. And as a gaming monitor, many would agree that its limited color display capacity is not a deal-breaker.</p><h4 id="3-Gaming-Performance"><a href="#3-Gaming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="3.Gaming Performance"></a>3.Gaming Performance</h4><p> To get the best out of any 4K UHD monitor, it’s absolutely important to have the right Graphics Card. The AMD FreeSync technology that ships with the ASUS MG28UQ monitor activates only when a compatible Graphics Card is detected. With the right GPU in place, FreeSync effectively reduces tearing and image stuttering, making this monitor by and large, a pleasure to use.</p><p> As mentioned above however, even with powerful GPUs, the maximum refresh rate possible on this 4K UHD monitor is 60Hz. In all fairness, this is due to the bandwidth limit on the input ports that ship with this monitor. DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 can easily support 144Hz refresh rates.</p><h4 id="5-Highlighted-Features"><a href="#5-Highlighted-Features" class="headerlink" title="5.Highlighted Features"></a>5.Highlighted Features</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-game-visual-settings.jpg"                      alt="asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-game-visual-settings"                ></p><p> ASUS claims their MG28HQ 4K monitor is “built for victory in the gaming arena”. With their exclusive GamePlus and GameVisual technologies, it’s hard to dispute their claim.</p><p> GamePlus lets users set on-screen timers and custom crosshairs that can significantly improve their gaming precision. The crosshairs or reticules can be activated even if the feature is not native to the video game in use. It’s a neat addition that’s sure to play well with most gamers.</p><p> GameVisual is a set of inbuilt presets designed to optimize users’ viewing experience. There’s a Racing mode, a Scenery mode, and an sRGB mode. GameVisual also has a Cinema Mode that’s perfect for watching 4K UHD movies and TV Shows. Its black level, cool hues and optimal saturation make for a great movie watching experience.</p><p> The ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor also has inbuilt 2 watt speakers that support a 3.5mm headphone jack. While many testers agree they’re not sufficient for gaming purposes, it’s a feature that makes this monitor a solid entertainment device.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> In conclusion, the ASUS MG28UQ monitor is a fantastic gaming and entertainment monitor. It certainly provides excellent gaming performance for its affordable price range. Its fast response rate of 1ms and 4k refresh rate of 60Hz deliver tear-free and steady-streaming imagery for most video games.</p><p> This 4K monitor ships with an adjustable stand is a benefit that cannot be overstated. This feature affords many functional and ergonomic benefits that users will greatly appreciate. Its 8 input ports also make it an ideal centerpiece for a fully equipped gaming station.</p><p> The bottom line is that the ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor delivers on its maker’s promise. With anticipated improvements to TN LCD screens and input port technologies, future iterations in this product line are likely to overcome the limited color rendering capacity and capped refresh rate of the ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor.</p><hr><p> Recommend: Use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora scrn Screen Recorder Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to record your gaming and edit your gaming video easily.

Here is the list of the top 10 best text effects that you should know.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Underwater Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Flame Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Glitch Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">3D Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Comic Book Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Blurry Fade on Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-7">Type on Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-8">Animate Along a Path</a></li><li><a href="#part1-9">Slide Text Effect</a></li><li><a href="#part1-10">Stripe Text Effect</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Create Text Effects</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Popular-Text-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-Popular-Text-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Popular Text Effects"></a>Part 1. Popular Text Effects</h2><p>There are certain text effects that you generally come across whether you are watching movies, web series, and videos on social media or video streaming platforms. We have compiled a list of the most popular text effects that are extremely relevant in the current times in videography.</p><h3 id="1-Underwater-Text-Effect"><a href="#1-Underwater-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Underwater Text Effect"></a>1. Underwater Text Effect</h3><p>Opening a video with the view of a beach and blue water is definitely stunning. But when you add an underwater text effect to display any title, it instantly grabs the attention of the viewers. In the underwater text effect, your text seems to be fixated or floating under the water. The text generally has a darker shade of blue over the light bluish water.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/under-water-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="under water text effect"                ></p><p>The text also has some distortion effect due to the waves in the water body so that it looks more realistic. There are different variations of that underwater text effect such as the text emerging out of water when there is a side view of the water body is taken. Another example of the variation is that text is floating over the water and having a watery gel or bubbly texture.</p><h3 id="2-Flame-Text-Effect"><a href="#2-Flame-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Flame Text Effect"></a>2. Flame Text Effect</h3><p>Flame text effect is extremely common in the opening and closing credits of a video especially when it is an action video. Generally, a dark background is set against the fiery text so that the flame effect is more prominent and eye-catching. In fact, some video creators prefer a fiery background out of which the text with flame text effect emerges and make the required impact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flame-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="flame text effect"                ></p><p>There are different variations of the flame text effect available which make the effect relevant even today. Instead of the flame text effect spread outside of the text, the effect is contained within the text when the text is large enough to accommodate flames prominently within it. Sometimes, the text is distorted as if the fire is burning the text.</p><h3 id="3-Glitch-Text-Effect"><a href="#3-Glitch-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. Glitch Text Effect"></a>3. Glitch Text Effect</h3><p>Glitch text effect is an extremely popular effect in modern times where retro video effects are reaching a new high.

What will you do with your iPhone X? It has no home button. Forget all your worries as the iPhone X tips and tricks help in easing your worries instantly. To take a screenshot on your iPhone X, press the side button and the volume up button simultaneously. The rest of the working is exactly as you see in other iPhones.</p><h4 id="2-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset"></a>2. Hard Reset</h4><p>What, if your iPhone X becomes unresponsive? iPhone X tips and tricks help you to force hard reset the iPhone X by swiftly pressing the volume up button first, then pressing the volume down button, and finally pressing and holding the side button. Apart from holding the side button, do not hold any of the volume buttons. You can observe the Apple logo when you hold the side button for 10-15 seconds and leave it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iPhone-X-Hard-Reset-Buttons-min.png"                      alt="hard reset"                ></p><h4 id="3-Battery-Percentage"><a href="#3-Battery-Percentage" class="headerlink" title="3. Battery Percentage"></a>3. Battery Percentage</h4><p>The iOS doesn’t feature a default battery percentage display. But, the settings can be used to turn on the display for battery percentage. The iPhone X is different, the setting has been removed from this device but don’t you worry. Just from the right side of the notch, swipe down and the option is integrated into the control center.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iOS_battery_percentage.jpg"                      alt="battery percentage"                ></p><h4 id="4-Virtual-Home-Button"><a href="#4-Virtual-Home-Button" class="headerlink" title="4. Virtual Home Button"></a>4. Virtual Home Button</h4><p>Are you missing the home button feature on your iPhone X device? Unfortunately, it is not really possible to bring it back physically but replicating the home button is definitely possible with the use of the software. So, what is the procedure to get a home button replica? Go to the general, click on the accessibility feature, then click on the assistive touch, and finally toggle it on. A virtual home button appears on the screen which you may modify to activate the shortcuts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-home-button.jpg"                      alt="home button"                ></p><h4 id="5-Optimize-Face-Id"><a href="#5-Optimize-Face-Id" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimize Face Id"></a>5. Optimize Face Id</h4><p>However fast the face ID is, at times, it cannot match up with the touch ID. But, the process of face ID can be accelerated with right habits and settings.</p><p>Firstly, click on the settings and then on the display and brightness feature to ensure “raise to wake” feature is enabled to stop you from having to tap on the screen. Swipe the phone upside so that your face is not seen directly on the screen and the face id gets time to authenticate and when you look to unlock your iPhone with the face ID, it directly takes you to the home screen. You may click on settings and then passcode and face ID to find the “require attention for face ID” feature to unlock the phone without looking directly on the screen. These iPhone X tips and tricks can greatly help to optimize the face ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/settings-face-id2.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><h4 id="6-Quickly-Return-Home"><a href="#6-Quickly-Return-Home" class="headerlink" title="6. Quickly Return Home"></a>6. Quickly Return Home</h4><p>If there’s an opened app screen on your iPhone X, you may go back to the home screen by using the home indicator. And, if multiple app pages are opened on your device’s home screen, you may swipe from the bottom edge which takes you back to the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-indicator-iphone-x.jpg"                      alt="return home"                ></p><h4 id="7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera"><a href="#7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera" class="headerlink" title="7.

Use Reachability Again"></a>9. Use Reachability Again</h4><p>Do you miss the reachability feature where the display would slide down to reach the icons with one hand on the top of the screen by just a double touch on the home button? Why miss, when you can get it? Yes, the feature has not been removed from the iPhone X but it has just been hidden.

Setting up the app</strong></p><p> Once you have the app downloaded, you can set it up for use with your phone. Open up the application and set the limits and focus on your screen so that it can be a mobile VR headset. Toggling the presets and setting the buttons for navigation on your headset will make sure that you can have control and a means to click the items you see on screen. After the screen is in focus and you feel immersed within the VR headset, you can then use the preset navigation buttons to find the content you are looking for.</p><p><strong>3.

Popular Text Effects"></a>Part 1. Popular Text Effects</h2><p>There are certain text effects that you generally come across whether you are watching movies, web series, and videos on social media or video streaming platforms. We have compiled a list of the most popular text effects that are extremely relevant in the current times in videography.</p><h3 id="1-Underwater-Text-Effect"><a href="#1-Underwater-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Underwater Text Effect"></a>1. Underwater Text Effect</h3><p>Opening a video with the view of a beach and blue water is definitely stunning. But when you add an underwater text effect to display any title, it instantly grabs the attention of the viewers. In the underwater text effect, your text seems to be fixated or floating under the water. The text generally has a darker shade of blue over the light bluish water.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/under-water-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="under water text effect"                ></p><p>The text also has some distortion effect due to the waves in the water body so that it looks more realistic. There are different variations of that underwater text effect such as the text emerging out of water when there is a side view of the water body is taken. Another example of the variation is that text is floating over the water and having a watery gel or bubbly texture.</p><h3 id="2-Flame-Text-Effect"><a href="#2-Flame-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Flame Text Effect"></a>2. Flame Text Effect</h3><p>Flame text effect is extremely common in the opening and closing credits of a video especially when it is an action video. Generally, a dark background is set against the fiery text so that the flame effect is more prominent and eye-catching. In fact, some video creators prefer a fiery background out of which the text with flame text effect emerges and make the required impact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flame-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="flame text effect"                ></p><p>There are different variations of the flame text effect available which make the effect relevant even today. Instead of the flame text effect spread outside of the text, the effect is contained within the text when the text is large enough to accommodate flames prominently within it. Sometimes, the text is distorted as if the fire is burning the text.</p><h3 id="3-Glitch-Text-Effect"><a href="#3-Glitch-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. Glitch Text Effect"></a>3. Glitch Text Effect</h3><p>Glitch text effect is an extremely popular effect in modern times where retro video effects are reaching a new high. The glitch text effect is designed to get the attention of the viewers instantly. In the glitch text effect, the text is divided into different sections and they are distorted or dispersed slightly as if your screen has a display issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/glitch-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="glitch text effect"                ></p><p>Glitch text effect is more prominent when it is applied to a large text having a light color against a dark background. The use of shadow and blur effect to get the desired glitch effect is common. More often than not, some short straight lines like strokes are placed around the text to enhance the glitch effect. Some creators prefer glitch text effect on 3D texts for a better visual appeal.</p><h3 id="4-3D-Text-Effect"><a href="#4-3D-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="4. 3D Text Effect"></a>4. 3D Text Effect</h3><p>3D text effect has been popular ever since its inception and its popularity has been steady in the videography world even today. Of course, with time, the effect has changed a lot to match the different niches of videos, and hence, you will come across a wide variety of 3D text effects. Starting from full screen texts and titles to adverts and promotional texts, 3D text effects find a place everywhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3d-text-video-effect.jpg"                      alt="3d text video effect"                ></p><p>Starting from 3D texts coming out of the background wall to 3D hologram text effect with retro look, you can apply any 3D effect to the texts and titles of your video as per relevancy. Most importantly, there is a wide scope for customization and personalization to captivate the viewers and get the message across clearly. You can go through 3D text After Effects tutorial and embed 3D texts in your video easily.</p><h3 id="5-Comic-Book-Text-Effect"><a href="#5-Comic-Book-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. Comic Book Text Effect"></a>5. Comic Book Text Effect</h3><p>Comic book text effect is an old-school style but its application in funny segments of a video is quite popular. Comic book typography has a superhero feel and it is mostly used while making the transition from one segment of a video to another. You will find several interview videos where the comic book text effect is used to show titles of different segments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/comic-book-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="comic book text effect"                ></p><p>Similarly, it is used for displaying texts and titles in anime videos. The text effect has a cartoonish look and a comic background to enhance the text effect. There could also be a blasting effect in the background that can act as a highlighter. The text color in the comic text effect also has a retro feel but bright in outlook.</p><h3 id="6-Blurry-Fade-on-Text-Effect"><a href="#6-Blurry-Fade-on-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="6.

Before you scratch your head to baldness, all these platforms allow you to upload and view videos on-demand. However, the technology that supports this function is much deeper. From the time you shoot your video until you share it with the world, it has undergone several post-production procedures, including compression using the AV1 codec.</p><p>The following is everything you need to know about the AV1 codec. As you keep reading, you will learn about the history of codec AV1, why it is popular, and its application in your video post-production. In addition, you will discover the best video editors to use when working with AV1 format videos. So let your journey to video editing supremacy begin.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Is it popular</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Where is AV1 codec used</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Avidemux</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Lightworks</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Filmora Video Editor</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Movavi Video Editor</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">VirtualDub</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">FAQ</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec"><a href="#Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is the av01 codec?"></a>Part1: What is the av01 codec?</h2><p>Initially, companies relied on proprietary technology to provide you with video content. For example, most video providers were using variants of MPEG codecs to edit their online content, with others preferring  for 4K content. However, using this method proved expensive and meant that some companies were missing out on the lucrative video streaming market.</p><p>As such, the Alliance for Open Media was formed in 2015 to develop an open-source, royalty-free video codec to outperform all previous versions. Through this collaboration, the Aomedia Video 1 (AV1) codec came to be.

Furthermore, the AOMedia patent license is fully compliant with the W3C Patent Policy, meaning you will not face any legal ramifications if you use the technology. As such, you will find the technology available on non-AOMedia member devices. For example, Broadcom offers AV1 codec support on its BCM 72190 and 72180 chipsets for Android TVs.</p><h2 id="Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video"><a href="#Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?"></a>Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?</h2><p>Now that you know what AV1 is, what are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Complete-Introduction-to-Snapchat’s-New-Feature"><a href="#A-Complete-Introduction-to-Snapchat’s-New-Feature" class="headerlink" title="A Complete Introduction to Snapchat’s New Feature"></a>A Complete Introduction to Snapchat’s New Feature</h2><p>Snapchat is one of the most popular instant messaging apps. The key feature that makes it different from other messaging apps is that users can send text messages, pictures, and short videos that disappear after they are viewed.</p><p>Over the years, Snapchat has introduced various features that elevated its status from being an instant messaging app to a social media platform. In November 2020, Snapchat rolled out a new feature called Spotlight that has become a massive hit among users.</p><p>The Spotlight feature aims to make Snapchat compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. As you may have guessed now, Spotlight is a collection of the most entertaining videos posted by app users.</p><p>Whether you want to post your videos on Snapchat Spotlight or want to know more about them, you just need to go through this article.</p><h2 id="What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat introduced Spotlight as a whole new section in its app that features several engaging short videos, also known as Snaps. The maximum duration of a video can be up to 1 minute or 60 seconds. Content creators must submit their videos to Spotlight so that moderators can review them and decide if they are worthy of featuring in the Spotlight section.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the intention of adding the Spotlight feature in Snapchat is to engage users through short-form user videos, just like TikTok. After the massive popularity gained by TikTok in 2020, many platforms tried following the same path to glory, including Snapchat and Instagram.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences"></a>Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences</h3><p>When comparing Snapchat and TikTok, there are specific differences that you can quickly notice. Let’s discuss those differences below:</p><p><strong>● Comments Sections</strong></p><p>While watching short-form videos on TikTok, you can leave your thoughts in the comments. However, you get no such comments section in the Snapchat Spotlight.</p><p><strong>● Privacy Protection</strong></p><p>If we talk about TikTok, you can view the display name of the content creator for each video. On the other hand, Snapchat enforces a strict privacy protection mechanism that hides the display name of creators if they are under 18. However, there’s an option to use a public profile if users below 18 wish to make their display name available to viewers.</p><h3 id="Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight"></a>Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight</h3><p>It’s easy to submit snaps (short-form videos) on Snapchat Spotlight. However, it is essential to ensure that your videos adhere to specific guidelines set by Snapchat. This section aims to make you familiar with them.</p><p><strong>Video Requirements</strong></p><p>The snaps that you want to submit to Spotlight should meet the following technical requirements:</p><ul><li>The minimum duration of a snap is 5 seconds, while the maximum is 60 seconds.</li><li>The video should be in portrait orientation.</li><li>The minimum aspect ratio of a snap is 3:4.</li><li>The horizontal resolution of a snap must be at least 640 px.</li><li>There shouldn’t be any logo in the snap.</li><li>The content of the snap should cover the complete frame.</li></ul><p>If your snap doesn’t meet the above-mentioned requirements, it will become ineligible for getting featured on Spotlight.</p><p><strong>Submission Terms</strong></p><p>There are certain community guidelines that apply to all Spotlight snaps. These guidelines ensure that the snaps within Spotlight entertain people without hurting their sentiments in any way.</p><p>While posting a snap on Spotlight, you need to avoid content that contains the following:</p><ul><li>Sexual acts</li><li>Harassment and bullying</li><li>Threats, violence, or harm</li><li>Illegal activities</li><li>Terrorism and hate speech</li></ul><p>You can go through the official <a class="link"   href="https://snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines" >Snapchat community guidelines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat Spotlight is relatively easy to use, especially if you are familiar with YouTube Shorts and TikTok. If you want to submit snaps to Spotlight, you will be happy to know that the whole process is quick and straightforward. The only thing that will consume a significant time is the snap creation itself.</p><p>If you already have a video or a snap idea that can make it to Spotlight, you need to know the steps for submitting a snap to Spotlight. We will discuss them in the next section.</p><h3 id="How-to-Post-on-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Post-on-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Post on Spotlight?"></a>How to Post on Spotlight?</h3><p>There are multiple methods to submit a snap to Spotlight.

Then, here comes another important question: How to become a successful Snapchat creator?</p><p>Similar to TikTok and YouTube Shorts, there’s massive competition among creators on Snapchat. Both existing and new creators submit numerous snaps daily to get featured on Spotlight. So, how come you improve your chances of making it to Spotlight?</p><p>Well, the first thing you need to know is the algorithm that Snapchat Spotlight utilizes to show snaps to users. Secondly, there are some tips to help you build your Snapchat community. We’ll discuss both of them in the following sections.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview"></a>Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview</h3><p>Snapchat makes use of a specialized algorithm for Spotlight. The algorithm decides what snaps to show to a particular user based on their interests and other factors.</p><p>The following are the key factors that the Spotlight algorithm considers for showing users the most relevant and exciting snaps.</p><p><strong>Unique Views</strong></p><p>A unique view means a user viewed a snap at least once in a single session. If a user views a snap multiple times in a single session, it will still be considered a unique view.</p><p><strong>Total View Time</strong></p><p>It represents the total time that users have spent watching a snap. If a user watches a single snap multiple times, the duration of each individual view will be added to the total view time.</p><p><strong>Number of Times the Video was Shared</strong></p><p>It represents the total number of times Snapchat users shared a particular snap with others.</p><p><strong>Number of Screenshots</strong></p><p>This factor considers the total number of times a screenshot was taken of a snap by a user.</p><h3 id="Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community"><a href="#Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community" class="headerlink" title="Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community"></a>Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community</h3><p>Your Snapchat community is your audience who loves to watch and interact with your snaps. Building a Snapchat community means growing your audience by delivering genuine, entertaining, and engaging content.</p><p>Here are some tips that can help you build a Snapchat community.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche</strong></p><p>Uploading random snaps will not earn you a loyal audience on Spotlight. So, you need to pick a specific niche, such as gaming, pranks, and comedy, to target a particular audience with your snaps.</p><p><strong>Use Snapchat’s Built-in Creative Tools</strong></p><p>Snapchat provides several tools to help you become more creative with your snaps. Using those creative tools is good as the Spotlight algorithm pretends to prioritize videos edited with Snapchat’s native tools.</p><p><strong>Stay Consistent</strong></p><p>It is challenging to post snaps consistently, especially if you are just starting. However, maintaining consistency with your Snaps will help you earn more audience.</p><h2 id="A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey"><a href="#A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey" class="headerlink" title="A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey"></a>A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey</h2><p>Hopefully, you have known how to use Snapchat Spotlight and been ready to plan your creator life.

So let’s dive into it.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show"><a href="#Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1.

Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show</h3><p>The main legal principles with podcasts are copyright, publicity rights, and trademark. Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.</p><p>Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal. If you’re unsure what you want, research similar names before settling.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify"><a href="#Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2.

Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify</h3><p>It is easy to search for your show’s potential name in a podcast directory. However, if the same name is already used, it is time to create a variation or start over.</p><p>You cannot submit your podcast to Spotify if there is a show with the same title.

Avoid overly long podcast names or “keyword stuffing,” as iTunes&#x2F;Apple Podcasts are clamping down on this.</p><p>When the audience comes and visits your channel, the name of it matters the most as it’s the most obvious thing that meets the eyes. In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot"><a href="#Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4.

You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce. You can practice saying your podcast name by completing the following sentences:</p><ul><li>“Hi, I’m the host of ___________.”</li><li>“Welcome to another episode of ___________.”</li><li>“You’ve got to listen to ___________!”</li></ul><p>Choose a name you like to say because you’ll be saying it.

Can 2 podcasts have the same name?"></a>1. Can 2 podcasts have the same name?</h3><p>The simple answer would be <strong>“No.”</strong> You cannot have a podcast whose name is similar to another. It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down.

Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast" class="headerlink" title="4.

What factors should you take into consideration? And what are some of the common mistakes made by podcasters when it comes to naming their shows? So let’s dive into it.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show-1"><a href="#Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show"></a>Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show</h3><p>The main legal principles with podcasts are copyright, publicity rights, and trademark. Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.</p><p>Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal. If you’re unsure what you want, research similar names before settling.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify-1"><a href="#Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify"></a>Tip 2. Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify</h3><p>It is easy to search for your show’s potential name in a podcast directory. However, if the same name is already used, it is time to create a variation or start over.</p><p>You cannot submit your podcast to Spotify if there is a show with the same title. Doing your research will save you time and hassle.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”-1"><a href="#Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”"></a>Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”</h3><p>Another goal in boosting or promoting your channel would be to make a channel name that is simple and easy to pronounce. Avoid overly long podcast names or “keyword stuffing,” as iTunes&#x2F;Apple Podcasts are clamping down on this.</p><p>When the audience comes and visits your channel, the name of it matters the most as it’s the most obvious thing that meets the eyes. In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot"></a>Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot</h3><p>As a podcast is an audio medium, your name should be easy to pronounce. You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce. You can practice saying your podcast name by completing the following sentences:</p><ul><li>“Hi, I’m the host of ___________.”</li><li>“Welcome to another episode of ___________.”</li><li>“You’ve got to listen to ___________!”</li></ul><p>Choose a name you like to say because you’ll be saying it. A lot.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Get-feedback-from-your-network-1"><a href="#Tip-5-Get-feedback-from-your-network-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5. Get feedback from your network"></a>Tip 5. Get feedback from your network</h3><p>Generating a name for a podcast is not an easy job. However, you can also get feedback from your network. For example, you are gathering suggestions from your friends or teammates. If your podcast has already got some followers, you can ask the audience for advice and let them comment below the podcast.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-Podcast-Name-Ideas-Generators-1"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-Podcast-Name-Ideas-Generators-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Can 2 podcasts have the same name?"></a>1. Can 2 podcasts have the same name?</h3><p>The simple answer would be <strong>“No.”</strong> You cannot have a podcast whose name is similar to another. It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down. It is all about originality.</p><h3 id="2-Should-I-name-my-podcast-my-name-1"><a href="#2-Should-I-name-my-podcast-my-name-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Should I name my podcast my name?"></a>2. Should I name my podcast my name?</h3><p>There’s nothing wrong with naming your podcast with your name as long as it is unique and stands out. You cannot simply name your podcast, i.e., “<strong>Joe Rogan</strong>.” Instead, your podcast can include your name creatively, such as, i.e., <strong>“The Joe Rogan Experience.”</strong></p><h3 id="3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1"><a href="#3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Can someone steal my podcast name?"></a>3. Can someone steal my podcast name?</h3><p>If your podcast is in its early stages, you may encounter some accounts pretending to be your channel. Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Should I rename my podcast?"></a>4. Should I rename my podcast?</h3><p>You can do that in the early stages of your show’s growth. But as your audience grows, changing the channel’s name will only disturb your audience. They might think the original content creator was changed or the purpose of the show has been changed.</p><p>Keeping to your originality and creativity will set your channel in the light. Your goal should be to choose a Podcast name that is unique from the beginning and work on growing it to its</p><p>best potential.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-exploring-the-depths-of-ifunnys-meme-experience/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Exploring the Depths of iFunny's Meme Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-stepwise-reduction-tactics-for-audio-levels-in-fl-studio/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Stepwise Reduction Tactics for Audio Levels in FL Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/lut-enthusiasts-delight-free-bundles-with-dji-minis-and-air-2/"><u>LUT Enthusiasts' Delight – Free Bundles with DJI Minis & Air 2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-bring-your-stories-alive-techniques-for-animation-in-text/"><u>[Updated] Bring Your Stories Alive  Techniques for Animation in Text</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-prodigy-ai-image-editing-arsenal/"><u>[New] In 2024, Prodigy AI Image Editing Arsenal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-tricks-and-tips-for-mastering-your-new-win11-experience/"><u>[Updated] Tricks & Tips for Mastering Your New Win11 Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-the-best-of-the-best-essential-tablet-sketching-tools/"><u>[New] The Best of the Best  Essential Tablet Sketching Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-a-critique-of-vivas-video-capabilities/"><u>[Updated] A Critique of Viva's Video Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/unlock-your-full-potential-with-zd-softwares-advanced-screenshot-techniques-for-2024/"><u>Unlock Your Full Potential with ZD Software's Advanced Screenshot Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-realme-10t-5g-pattern-lock-if-forgotten-6-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Realme 10T 5G Pattern Lock if Forgotten? 6 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-boosting-brand-visibility-essential-insta-highlight-upgrades/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Brand Visibility  Essential Insta Highlight Upgrades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-virtual-victory-the-leading-ladies-of-gaming/"><u>[New] Virtual Victory  The Leading Ladies of Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, CatchEmAll Celebrate National Pokémon Day with Virtual Location On Samsung Galaxy F14 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-easy-screencasting-techniques-systematic-guidebook/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Easy Screencasting Techniques  Systematic Guidebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-chocolate-chronicles-in-depth-screen-recorder-for-sweet-treats/"><u>[Updated] Chocolate Chronicles  In-Depth Screen Recorder for Sweet Treats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/navigating-video-uploads-and-enhancements-in-instagram-for-2024/"><u>Navigating Video Uploads and Enhancements in Instagram for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

For most people, it is the latter, which is why short Tiktok or Instagram videos with peppy background music get so much engagement. Faster songs bring out the energy and are memorable and passionate.</p><p>So, if you are editing videos you want to use for advertising products, a tutorial video, or a fun edit, speeding up the audio should help you. You can use an excellent <strong>audio speed changer</strong> to properly increase the sound speed of different songs quickly, without quality loss or cracking during the playback.</p><p>Multiple useful options are available in the market that promises high-quality audio speed adjustment functions. In this post, we shall look into apps and software with this function on mobile devices and desktops, discussing their features and how to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/10-best-apps-to-speed-audio-speed-on-mobile-0.jpg"                      alt="tiktok music"                ></p><h2 id="Best-10-Apps-for-Audio-Speed-Changing-in-Android-and-iOS-Devices"><a href="#Best-10-Apps-for-Audio-Speed-Changing-in-Android-and-iOS-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Best 10 Apps for Audio Speed Changing in Android and iOS Devices"></a>Best 10 Apps for Audio Speed Changing in Android and iOS Devices</h2><p>Different currently available apps are operable on mobile devices and can effectively support high-quality speed adjustment settings for videos. These apps come with mechanisms that increase the speed of the sound without affecting pitch heavily.</p><p>Some apps require payment to operate better quality audio adjustment and other editing features. But they have varying price plans with different sets of advanced functions. Alternatively, instead of <strong>audio speed changer</strong> download options, you can also go for online tools. It is essential to consider the features available in them to decide which is the best option for your editing needs.</p><p>For that, here is a list of the top 10 mobile-based apps for audio speed and <strong>tempo editing</strong> that you can use on Android or iOS devices.</p><h3 id="1-Music-Speed-Changer"><a href="#1-Music-Speed-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

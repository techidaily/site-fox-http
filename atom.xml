    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Elevate-Meetings-Key-Strategies-with-Zoom-Adapter"><a href="#Elevate-Meetings-Key-Strategies-with-Zoom-Adapter" class="headerlink" title="Elevate Meetings: Key Strategies with Zoom Adapter"></a>Elevate Meetings: Key Strategies with Zoom Adapter</h2><p>Today, face-to-face contact is severely constrained in modern society, making the zoom for pc download quite helpful. One of its finest features is the ability to record meetings in order to capture every moment as a video. Using the Zoom app requires understanding how to convert ZOOM recordings to MP4 video format for free online. Zoom is a really practical technology that, as you undoubtedly well know, enables individuals to continue working or attending school despite the epidemic. If you have a Zoom recording, you undoubtedly have questions about how to get to the videos. Additionally, you must convert your Zoom recordings to mp4 if you detect that they are an unknown file format. However, Zoom recordings are immediately saved to your PC in MP4 format. However, sometimes the conversion is unsuccessful, leaving you with .Zoom files for your recordings. In this situation, you must convert the zoom recording to MP4.</p><p>One of its most intriguing features is the ability to record meetings in order to save every event as a film. One of the most important aspects of utilizing the Zoom app is learning how to convert a ZOOM video recording format to MP4 for free online. Zoom is a tool or software that enables several users to participate in a videoconference. It operates through meetings that attempt to replicate many of the activities we may perform at a meeting in person of any sort. Zoom allows you to record meetings, and after the meeting is over, it will begin to convert the recording to MP4. But a number of factors might lead this phase to fail. You may be wondering, “How do I convert a Zoom recording to MP4?” when you encounter the Zoom failed to convert recording problem. Thankfully, it’s a rather straightforward procedure that doesn’t need for any additional software. This article will demonstrate three different approaches for converting Zoom recordings to MP4 files. However, you must be the host of the meeting or have authorization to record it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Way-1-Convert-the-Local-Recording-in-Zoom-App"><a href="#Way-1-Convert-the-Local-Recording-in-Zoom-App" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Convert the Local Recording in Zoom App"></a>Way 1. Convert the Local Recording in Zoom App</h2><p>Zoom provides both local and cloud recording options. Users of the former may capture meeting video and audio thanks to its availability to both free and paid members. The latter allows paying subscribers to audio, video, and text-record the conference. Additionally, the recording file formats include TXT, MP4, and M4A. At the conclusion of a meeting, Zoom automatically transforms the raw video to an mp4 file. However, the video will be stored as a .zoom file if the operation is aborted. A.mp4 file that is an MP4 contains both audio and video data. M4A only has audio files in it. All MP4 files may be played using the M3U playlist file. Additionally, meeting chat conversations are saved in a TXT file.</p><h5 id="Step1Create-the-Recording"><a href="#Step1Create-the-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create the Recording"></a>Step1Create the Recording</h5><p>The recording must first be made by entering the Zoom meeting and selecting Record. Zoom gives you the option of either PC storage or cloud storage for the recordings. Both choices offer advantages and disadvantages. You should convert the files into mp4 if you want to save them on your computer since they are smaller without sacrificing quality and take up less space. You will need a Zoom account to store the files if you decide to use cloud storage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-1.jpg"                      alt="create the recording"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Download-the-Recording"><a href="#Step2Download-the-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step2Download the Recording"></a>Step2Download the Recording</h5><p>By accessing the Zoom folder in your computer’s Documents folder, you may quickly locate your Zoom recordings. Alternately, copy and paste the address shown here: Change “USERNAME” to the username you use for your machine in the path: Users&#x2F;USERNAME&#x2F;Documents. If you wish to arrange all of your films, the date, time, and meeting name are all included in the local Zoom folders. You may initially attempt manually converting the recording to MP4 if Zoom’s conversion of local recordings fails. Observe the directions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-2.jpg"                      alt="download the recording"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Launch-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client-application"><a href="#Step3Launch-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client-application" class="headerlink" title="Step3Launch the Zoom Desktop Client application"></a>Step3Launch the Zoom Desktop Client application</h5><p>On your computer, launch the Zoom program.

Record Zoom Meeting with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Zoom has a recording option, however you can only record a meeting if you are the host or have permission to do so. As a result, you are unable to record meetings anytime you want. A screen recording program from a third party, like Filmora from Wondershare, is the greatest answer to these issues. This professional program for Windows and Mac comes with a screen recording capability that enables you to record your screen activity in excellent definition, including zoom calls. Additionally, you have a variety of customizable recording options, including picture-in-picture, output format, frame rate, and quality.</p><p>The default Zoom recording is made in poor quality and offers no customizing options. Additionally, in order to record the meeting as a participant, you must have the host’s consent. MP4 is the ideal file type for saving Zoom meetings. This is due to the great compatibility of the MP4 format with a variety of hardware and media players. The MP4 format also provides high quality while being somewhat modest in size. Use Wondershare Filmora to get over these problems and capture Zoom meetings in excellent definition. The captured video may be transferred, compressed, and given further editing as required with this program.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>Steps to Record Zoom and Export the Video as Mp4 Format</strong></p><h5 id="Step1Download-and-Install-Filmora"><a href="#Step1Download-and-Install-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step1Download and Install Filmora"></a>Step1Download and Install <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>In the first step, visit the official website to download the latest version of Filmora for your PC.

To convert a Zoom recording to MP4, use the steps listed above. If your Zoom recording isn’t in MP4 format, as mentioned above, you may convert it using a video converter.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-premier-platform-for-seminar-titles/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Premier Platform for Seminar Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-flattening-lines-easy-curve-transformation/"><u>[New] Flattening Lines Easy Curve Transformation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-editmasters-selecting-the-best-4k-screens-for-creatives/"><u>[New] In 2024, EditMasters Selecting the Best 4K Screens for Creatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-making-your-own-youtube-beginnings-and-endings-cheaply/"><u>[New] Making Your Own YouTube Beginnings & Endings Cheaply</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-beat-the-best-substitutes-for-samsungs-vr-camera-gear-360/"><u>[Updated] Beat the Best Substitutes for Samsung's VR Camera Gear 360</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-into-another-realm-the-vr-timeline/"><u>[Updated] Into Another Realm The VR Timeline</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cutting-edge-techniques-for-cropping-images-on-the-web/"><u>2024 Approved Cutting Edge Techniques for Cropping Images on the Web</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-workable-fixes-to-the-sim-not-provisioned-mm2-error-on-samsung-galaxy-a24-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Workable Fixes to the SIM not provisioned MM#2 Error on Samsung Galaxy A24 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-from-vivo-y27s-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass Google FRP Lock from Vivo Y27s Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-are-location-permissions-life360-on-motorola-razr-40-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, What are Location Permissions Life360 On Motorola Razr 40 Ultra? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/pokemon-go-error-12-failed-to-detect-location-on-motorola-edge-40-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Pokemon Go Error 12 Failed to Detect Location On Motorola Edge 40 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/unlock-off-screen-app-functionality-win-1011s-best-recovery-approaches-6-key-techniques/"><u>Unlock Off-Screen App Functionality: Win 10/11'S Best Recovery Approaches (6 Key Techniques)</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s time to stop wasting time and money on ineffective videos that don’t get results. If you follow the tips below, you’ll have a solid strategy for creating professional-looking testimonial videos that your customers will love and share.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Identify-Your-Perfect-Customer"><a href="#Identify-Your-Perfect-Customer" class="headerlink" title="Identify Your Perfect Customer"></a>Identify Your Perfect Customer</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/identify-your-perfect-customer.jpg"                      alt="identify your perfect customer"                ></p><p>The first key tactic to creating a perfect testimonial video is identifying your perfect customer. The more you know about the type of person who will benefit the most from using your product or service, the better you can tailor your video content to speak directly to them.</p><p>It may seem like a daunting task, but there are several ways you can go about defining who this person is:</p><ul><li>If possible, talk with current customers and ask them what they love about their experience with your business.</li><li>If that’s not an option for some reason (maybe there aren’t any current customers), consider hiring a research firm or marketing agency that specializes in surveying potential customers and asking questions like “What would encourage you to buy from us?” or “How could we improve our service?” With this information in hand, it should be easier than ever before!</li></ul><h2 id="Ask-Authentic-Questions"><a href="#Ask-Authentic-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Ask Authentic Questions"></a>Ask Authentic Questions</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ask-authentic-questions.jpg"                      alt="ask authentic questions"                ></p><ul><li>Open-ended questions are the best way to engage customers and get them to speak naturally.</li><li>Make your question relevant to the customer and your product or service.</li><li>The more specific you can be with these questions, the better. For example, if you’re selling pet products online, ask about their pets’ names, breed, and color (if applicable).</li><li>If there’s no good reason for asking a question then don’t!

After all, that’s the point of using video testimonials in the first place! Make sure you have a tight script with a few specific questions written down. You should also plan out how you’re going to arrange these questions into a flow.</p><p>When asking someone for their thoughts on a topic or issue, there’s always going to be some variation in how people respond. Some will talk about personal experiences; others will talk about what they’ve learned from others’ experiences; still, others might share some advice for future generations who might encounter similar problems. The key here is that your main objective is not necessarily the information itself (though this can help), but rather the emotion behind it—what effect does this experience have on your audience?</p><p>Asking open-ended questions allows people greater freedom when responding—and while this may sound like an ideal situation when creating content, it often results in less-than-ideal responses when creating content at scale since you won’t always get exactly what you want out of every shot.</p><h2 id="Lighting-Sound-and-Video-Quality-Matter"><a href="#Lighting-Sound-and-Video-Quality-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Lighting, Sound, and Video Quality Matter"></a>Lighting, Sound, and Video Quality Matter</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/lighting-sound-video-quality.jpg"                      alt="lighting sound video quality"                ></p><p>Lighting, sound, and video quality matter.</p><p>This is a given. If you want your testimonial videos to be effective and believable, they need to be properly lit, recorded with good audio quality, and captured in high resolution. While these may seem like obvious must-haves for any video production project—and they are—it’s important to remember that there are many factors at play when it comes to how your audience will perceive the final product.</p><h2 id="Really-Listen-to-Your-Prospects"><a href="#Really-Listen-to-Your-Prospects" class="headerlink" title="Really Listen to Your Prospects"></a>Really Listen to Your Prospects</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/listen-to-your-prospects.jpg"                      alt="listen to your prospects"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>When you’re listening to your customers, don’t just take notes on what they say. Also, look at their body language and eye movement. This can tell you a lot about whether they are telling the truth or not, and it will give you an idea of what may be going on in their head.</p><p>If someone says “I love this product,” but then shows their eyes darting around nervously, that could mean that they’re worried about saying something nice about the product because it’s not really meeting their needs.

No matter if you want to shoot nature, urban life, beaches, clouds or sunrise, compacting a couple of hours of footage into a few minutes can be rather powerful visual narrative.</p><p>A time lapse video is basically a sequence of photos which have been shot at an interval and then player with a much faster speed. The time interval in which the photos have been shot could vary from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the duration of the video you want to create. This is substantially different from a regular video where the photos are recorded in quick succession by the camera and then stringed together in real time. Time lapses can be a very handy tool for recording scenes which occur over a considerable period of time (for eg. Sunset, sunrise, eclipses, budding of flowers, clouds etc).</p><p>Are you an amateur travel photographer who has recently bought a GoPro cam and wondering which the best setting for time lapse photography is? Are you still not certain about which editing software to use for editing your GoPro time lapses? In this post we will discuss how to shoot a time lapse video with GoPro Hero 5 and how to edit the video with Filmora.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1:Shooting a time lapse video with GoPro Hero5</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Making time lapse videos with Wondershare Filmora</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Shooting-a-time-lapse-video-with-GoPro-Hero5"><a href="#Part-1-Shooting-a-time-lapse-video-with-GoPro-Hero5" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Shooting a time lapse video with GoPro Hero5"></a>Part 1: Shooting a time lapse video with GoPro Hero5</h2><h4 id="1-The-best-time-lapse-settings-in-GoPro"><a href="#1-The-best-time-lapse-settings-in-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="1. The best time lapse settings in GoPro:"></a><strong>1. The best time lapse settings in GoPro:</strong></h4><p>Selecting the right setting is the most difficult part about shooting a GoPro time lapse. Here is what you need to do:</p><ul><li>At first, you need to set the right interval of shooting</li><li>Next, you need to choose the optimal resolution</li><li>Then, you have to select the exact playback rate</li><li>Lastly, you need to decide on the length of your video.</li></ul><p>Below parameters are the best time-lapse intervals for the GoPro Hero5 Black:</p><ul><li>0.5s for up-close shooting birds, insects and other small moving things;</li><li>1.0s for filming in urban areas like flowing traffic, people, buses etc;</li><li>2.0s for shooting clouds as well as touristy areas;</li><li>5.0s for filming sunset, sunrise and normal moving clouds;</li><li>10s for shooting moving clouds and construction videos</li><li>30s for taking shots of shadows, drying puddles, thunderstorms etc.;</li><li>60s for blooming flowers, growing plants or any other long term process.</li></ul><p>Choose 12 MP as the resolution and use 30 frames per second for your videos, which is the ideal settings for getting the most fluid-looking and realistic time-lapses. Now you need to decide on how long you want to shoot. While shooting at an interval of 60 seconds, you would have to place your camera on the location for quite some time, so as to get a time-lapse of considerable duration. If you shoot for 10 minutes with 1s interval, then you will be getting about 20 seconds of time lapse footage which is surely enough for creating a quick montage.</p><h4 id="2-Tips-before-your-shoot"><a href="#2-Tips-before-your-shoot" class="headerlink" title="2. Tips before your shoot"></a><strong>2. Tips before your shoot</strong></h4><p>First, you need to look for the right location. Make the most out of the rule of thirds and always ensure that you have a focal point of your time lapse footage. While shooting a crowded street try to position your camera at a vantage point from where you can capture the movement of the people and even that of the clouds.</p><p>Make use of good tripod, a fast and spacious SD card, a suction mount and always keep an extra battery. Gorilla Pod with its 3 in 1 mount is probably the best tripod for action cams. A longer cord can be of great help in situations where you have a power source. This would allow you to shoot hours and hours of footage on your GoPro.</p><h4 id="3-Steps-for-making-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#3-Steps-for-making-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="3.

How to create a video to combine the highlights of short track speed skating 2022?"></a>Part 2. How to create a video to combine the highlights of short track speed skating 2022?</h2><p>The best way to present any news related to any sports event is to create a short video containing all the highlights of the event. For example, you can create a video combining all the highlights of short track speed skating 2022 that we have presented in the previous section. You can also collect short clips of the event from social media platforms that have been captured by audiences.</p><p>To create such a highlight video on any sports event, there are certain videos effects commonly used that you should know about.</p><p><strong>Transitions</strong> – Since you are going to use a lot of still photos, the transition from one photo to another should be smooth. This is where transition effects come into the play so that the viewer does not feel any jarring effect and sudden changes as they move from one slide in your video to another.</p><p><strong>Slow Motion</strong> – If you have collected from short clips of the event, you can use slow motion effect to prolong the clip and give enough time for your viewer to watch it. Slow motion effect is quite captivating and intriguing in today’s videography world.</p><p><strong>Motion Tracking</strong> – Using motion tracking, you can track the movement of a particular object or athlete in a video. This helps to attach certain elements such as clipart, text, icon to that particular athlete throughout the video for easy identification by the viewers.</p><p><strong>Pan and Zoom</strong> – Pan and Zoom is the most commonly used video effect that is applied to still footage. While the footage zooms out, texts and titles are shown or a voiceover is played so that the graphic on the screen does not stay static.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>To create a video based on any sport event such as short track speed skating highlights, you need a professional video editor where you can get all the video effects and elements in one place.

Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate. The displaying frame rate generally stays fixed for any video project.</p><p>The shooting frame rate determines how slow your video will look. If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos. We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-60-fps"><a href="#1-60-fps" class="headerlink" title="1. 60 fps"></a>1. 60 fps</h2><p>Anything higher than 30 fps is for creating slow-motion videos. 60 fps is the standard slow motion frame rate for Hollywood movies. You must have come across scenes where the superhero walks out slowly in a dramatic manner. Such scenes are shot at 60fps and displayed at 24 or 30 fps. Besides, this frame rate is suitable for capturing character’s emotions as well.</p><p>Basically, you should use 60 fps when the action is already slow. Some examples are someone walking out of an action sequence, blowing off candles, or getting dressed. Shooting video at 60fps enhances the smoothness of the action. The visuals look more detailed and real. That is why people shoot 4K videos at 60fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for any action that is already slow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="60 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="2-120-fps"><a href="#2-120-fps" class="headerlink" title="2. 120 fps"></a>2. 120 fps</h2><p>Let us assume that you are shooting at 120 fps and displaying at 30 fps. The video will play 4 times slower than it is in real life. The slow-motion effect will be two times slower than shooting at 60fps. If you shoot slow action at 120 fps, the output will be unusually slow and visually unpleasant. Therefore, you should shoot fast action scenes at 120 fps.</p><p>Some of the examples are someone running, playing slow sports, or drifting a car. You will find professionals using 120 fps for showing the slow-motion football kick and baseball bat swing. The scene will come out super smooth and visually crisp. 120 fps is widely used in the gaming industry for fast-paced action games.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast-paced action and fast moving subjects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/120-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="120 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="3-180-fps"><a href="#3-180-fps" class="headerlink" title="3. 180 fps"></a>3. 180 fps</h2><p>The scenes that are suitable for 120 fps are also suitable for 180 fps. This means you can shoot fast-moving subjects, objects, and elements. Some of the examples are horse riding, subject running, riding a bike, and likewise. But when you shoot at 180 fps, your objective is to show down the action much further.</p><p>This means that a scene shot at 180 fps will look slower than at 120 fps. You must have seen scenes where an object in motion is slowed down and zoomed in for detail. Such scenes are perfect for 180 frame rate. You may not achieve super slow mow scenes but it is going to be somewhere near that.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast moving action with emphasis on slow downing motion further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/180-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="180 fps slow motion"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130887/7443" target="_top" id="2130887">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130887" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130887/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-240-fps"><a href="#4-240-fps" class="headerlink" title="4. 240 fps"></a>4. 240 fps</h2><p>When you are capturing an action that is too fast for your eyes to see, you should use 240 fps. For example, when you are watching a fast-paced sports event, your eyes cannot capture all movements. When you capture those scenes at 240 fps, the output video will look more comfortable for the eyes. The use of 240 fps is very popular in sports like cricket.</p><p>The broadcasters show replays in slow motion by capturing bat and ball strikes at 240 fps. You will also come across videos like slow mow water splashes that are shot at 240 fps. In action movies, you can see the hero punching the villain in the face. Then the scene shows the impact of the punch on the face with skin and muscle getting shattered. Such scenes are perfectly shot at 240 fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for action that are too fast for the eyes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/240-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="240 fps slow motion video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972698/19272" target="_top" id="1972698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918679/19272" target="_top" id="1918679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-480-fps"><a href="#5-480-fps" class="headerlink" title="5. 480 fps"></a>5. 480 fps</h2><p>If you want super slow motion video, you have to shoot at 480 fps. The 480 frame rate is considered to be the base of super slow motion. There are higher frame rates available for more enhanced super slow-motion videos. When you shoot at 480 fps, the video will play 16 times slower. This is usual in showcasing extremely fast movements.</p><p>For example, when you are shooting with a gun, the bullet goes out at lightning speed. You will need 480 fps to capture the scene of the bullet coming out of the gun and show it in extremely slow motion. Some other scenarios are slicing a vegetable with a knife, dropping a water-filled balloon on the floor, or performing skateboard skills. All such scenarios should be shot at 480 fps for super slow video output.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting extremely fast actions and show in super slow motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/480-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="480 fps slow motion"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134240/18498" target="_top" id="2134240">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134240" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="540" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134240/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no definite answer to which is the best frame rate for slow motion. It completely depends on what you are shooting. Yes, it is true that 60 fps is the standard slow motion fps. But 60 fps is only suitable when the action is low as well. Different frame rates are suitable for different scenes. The faster the action you are shooting, the higher should be the frame rate. For smooth super slow motion video, you should consider shooting at 480 fps. Frame rate beyond 480 is suitable for capturing slow-motion explosion videos.</p><p>Frame rate is an extremely important parameter in videography.

These vignettes generally have a theme and therefore you can customize them to match your blog.</p><p>You can design your 5X5 Vignette – like the one below - using the 5X5 Vimeo Channel. This YouTube video shows a girl is playing snooker.</p><h4 id="2-Interview"><a href="#2-Interview" class="headerlink" title="2.Interview"></a>2.Interview</h4><p>With this type of video, both you and your interviewee can benefit from increased viewership and attract links. The video is particularly advantageous in improving your rankings on search engines. Just one caveat; make sure you choose a topic that is relevant to your viewers as well as your interviewee’s audiences.</p><p>Hope you enjoy and learn from the video below where Marie Forleo interviews Rachel Hanfling on how to simplify any message. Like Marie, you can call experts from specific fields and interview them to get their advice on the queries posed by your viewers.</p><h4 id="3-Teach-using-a-“How-to”-Video"><a href="#3-Teach-using-a-“How-to”-Video" class="headerlink" title="3.Teach using a “How to” Video"></a>3.Teach using a “How to” Video</h4><p>Demonstrating, almost anything, using a “How to” video is a great way to teach a process by breaking it into a step-by-step protocol. The video ideally, has close-up shots while the person performs a particular task for his viewers.</p><p>BBC Good Food nails the “how-to” video concept. It has devoted an entire tab for “how-to” tutorials that have a range of videos from buying raw materials – the best meat in the market – to making delicious recipes.</p><h4 id="4-Shoot-a-candid-video-prank"><a href="#4-Shoot-a-candid-video-prank" class="headerlink" title="4.Shoot a candid video prank"></a>4.Shoot a candid video prank</h4><p>Let’s say today is April fool’s day. You can choose to upload a video prank. All you need is a victim and a camera that shoots all the events candidly. If you are a team that is hosting the blog, you can plot a prank on a fellow crew member. Such a video improves the fun quotient as well as entertains your audience. Let your viewers enjoy a good laugh.</p><p>Check out these adorable kids as they perform a video prank – Just for laughs!</p><h4 id="5-Tutor-with-the-screencast"><a href="#5-Tutor-with-the-screencast" class="headerlink" title="5.Tutor with the screencast"></a>5.Tutor with the screencast</h4><p>You can also upload a modified version of the “how-to” tutorial called the screencast. Essentially, a screencast projects your computer screen in the form of a video so that you can train your audience to acquire a particular skill – for example you may teach people how to edit photos using Photoshop.</p><p>In the following video, Tyler Moore demonstrates ‘how to start your own blog’ by performing the exercise on screen.</p><h4 id="6-Shoot-a-documentary"><a href="#6-Shoot-a-documentary" class="headerlink" title="6.Shoot a documentary"></a>6.Shoot a documentary</h4><p>Shooting a documentary is perhaps the best option for a travel blog or a foodie, road trip. Your viewer can actually picture the culture, food, people and terrain; thus, get a feel of a new destination.</p><p>So you think this type of video is suitable for your blog; watch the following video that features the travel vlogger himself - Brain Cox. He has traveled across 30 countries and enjoys shooting videos of his experiences as he travels the world.</p><h4 id="7-Upload-rare-events"><a href="#7-Upload-rare-events" class="headerlink" title="7.Upload rare events"></a>7.Upload rare events</h4><p>Video coverage of rare natural events can be posted if you have a handy camera at that moment. For example, if your blog funds a charity that supports people affected by a disaster; you can post videos to show the intensity of damage caused so that philanthropists understand the need of the hour and donate.</p><p>For example, the video below shows clips that film an approaching tsunami. National geographic has benefited from these videos because someone was fortunate enough to have a camera while it struck, thought of recording it and lived to tell the tale.</p><h4 id="8-Just-Talk"><a href="#8-Just-Talk" class="headerlink" title="8.Just Talk"></a>8.Just Talk</h4><p>This is by far the most common type of video that bloggers upload. You just need your webcam, the time and a topic that you have insights about.

Filmmakers are now able to create wonders with cinematic, jaw dropping results that were earlier just impossible in Hollywood productions. But if you are new to this world of drone then you must be searching for some information regarding how to shoot aerial videos using drone to get professional results. If so, then don’t worry! Because the article below will provide you complete information about impressive filming techniques with latest drones.</p><p> Let’s check a video tutorial first:</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone"><a href="#Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Filming with Drone"></a>Tips for Filming with Drone</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Techniques</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Weather</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Editing</a></li></ul><h3 id="Techniques"><a href="#Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Techniques"></a>Techniques</h3><p> In order to get best results with your aerial shoot, try these professional techniques:</p><h4 id="1-Go-Slow"><a href="#1-Go-Slow" class="headerlink" title="1.  Go Slow"></a>1.  Go Slow</h4><p> The very first recommendation to beginners from professionals is to move slowly. It leaves cinematic impression on viewers as your slow motion makes them think that you are shooting from a larger platform such as helicopter. No doubt, it will increase the production value and shots will appear perfectly crafted and well controlled.</p><p> Ensure that you operate RC control stick very smoothly. Take help from gradual movements so that undesired shakes in footage can be avoided and at the same time care about slow acceleration and deceleration to avoid distortion from end results.</p><p> It is good to pre-plan as well as visual most of your aerial shots. One should prefer to advance guard his filming location so that all pros and cons can be pre-observed and proper planning can be done to get rid of limitations of that area. If you know your requirements in advance and have an effective plan for the site then you will definitely be able to make most out of your limited battery life of drone. You will not feel happy if some shots are missed just because of mismanagement and drained drone battery.</p><h4 id="2-Two-Axis-type-Movement"><a href="#2-Two-Axis-type-Movement" class="headerlink" title="2.  Two Axis type Movement"></a>2.  Two Axis type Movement</h4><p> There are few hidden tricks behind those breathtaking shots of big budget movies and it is good to implement them with care. Most of those professionals prefer to implement two axis type movements simultaneously. They often make some arrangements to fly backwards as well as downwards at the same time but note that such movements must be controlled at much smoother rate with stable adjustments.</p><h4 id="3-Strafe"><a href="#3-Strafe" class="headerlink" title="3.  Strafe"></a>3.  Strafe</h4><p> When you have to focus on attractive landscapes then the best idea is to use sideways movements or the strafing feature. It will help you to show landscapes with different prospective and results will naturally be more impressive. Usually, most of the shots over landscapes in Hollywood movies are recorded with aerial motions where drone keep on moving forward and backward, so if you try the strafing effect then it will definitely be a unique and awesome idea. This recording style will also help you to reveal various eye catching features of the landscape.</p><h4 id="4-Orbit"><a href="#4-Orbit" class="headerlink" title="4.  Orbit"></a>4.  Orbit</h4><p> If you want to achieve Orbit then you have to control your drone strafe movements towards left or right side while pulling that yaw stick to exactly opposite direction. Let me make it clear that yaw stick is a control stick that you will find on left side of your drone controller and it is there to control rotation action of drone. Note that, you need to have more practice on that yaw control because most of users, even professionals end up spinning much faster and results are too bad.</p><h4 id="5-Fly-Through-Shots"><a href="#5-Fly-Through-Shots" class="headerlink" title="5.  Fly Through Shots"></a>5.  Fly Through Shots</h4><p> Here is something more cinematic but it is going to be risky enough. You need to be more careful to capture this type of shots because it demands you complete attention on controller screen for drone navigation. If you believe on your piloting skills then you will definitely achieve success in this recording action. When these shots are captured perfectly, they have power to capture attention of viewers and they will soon become fan of your cinematography skills along with your risk management strategy.</p><h3 id="Weather"><a href="#Weather" class="headerlink" title="Weather"></a>Weather</h3><p> When we talk about weather then it is something out of your control and you have just one option that is to pray mercy from Mother Nature. To capture some of the best shots you will often need to fly in a clean sky and you definitely don’t need that heavy fog and rain. This issue is more common in winter days, especially when you are working on high altitudes that get freeze due to cold.</p><p><strong>What to do?</strong></p><ul><li>The first most important trick is to avoid taking shots in windy day. Generally, most of the advanced drone units can bear the pressure of up to 25-35 mph wind but if it goes above this range then your footage will get spoiled. It is not a good idea to simply rely on post processing techniques like jello effect etc. However, few professionals are able to refine their shots with Wrap Stabilization Setting to get best results.</li><li>Choose golden hours of the day to shoot your footage. The time of sunset and sunrise will help your footage to stand out as shadows are highly visible during this time and it will naturally create a natural impact. People rarely shoot scenes at sunrise time so you can try to implement this trick to prove yourself different from those common aerial shooters.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105860/7443" target="_top" id="2105860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h3><p> Some of the most common camera settings that demand your focus are flat image profile and shutter speed.</p><ul><li>**Flat Image Profile:**There is no doubt to say that your camera settings are going to leave great impact on your footage so use them effectively. Prefer to work on flattest camera profile as it will help you to get impressive dynamic range with aerial camera. This technique of shooting helps users to prevent clouds and sky and also helps users to retain details from darkest point on ground.</li><li><strong>Control Shutter Speed:</strong><br> It is good to work with lower shutter speed and in order to avoid strobing effect one must prefer to shot by keeping camera close to ground. Keep it somewhere around 100th to 250th level of second, one can also work with ND filter to control shutter speed to desired lower level. In case if you work with 500th or 100th part of second then you will naturally obtain sharper frames with it leads to footage with heavy strobing.</li></ul><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p> If you need to edit your shots to get customized results then it is most important to choose a professional and high quality software tool. One of the best professional recommendations is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> due to its intuitive interface and ability to edit 4k video shoots.

But note that, you need to save those multiple sections of files one by one while deleting the unwanted portions.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Scene Detection:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection.jpg"                      alt="scene detection"                ></p><p> If you want to reach to certain segment of video quickly then use scene detection function.

Unlike the ordinary videos, virtual reality videos create in illusion of the user being part of the video through the rendition of 3D images. The viewing of such videos is not restricted to computer or television screens and depending on the video or the kind of content being watched, the user can also interact with the video.</p><p> Just like with the ordinary videos, virtual reality videos can be created at the beginning when a video is being recorded or captured using 360 degrees video cameras. The videos can also be made from computer generated content using VR immersive video enabled applications. The formats adopted by virtual reality videos will vary from the software and the device used in the production of the videos.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Differences-between-360°-video-and-VR-video"><a href="#Differences-between-360°-video-and-VR-video" class="headerlink" title="Differences between 360° video and VR video"></a>Differences between 360° video and VR video</h2><p> Virtual Reality is no longer the next big thing, but rather the current big thing. However, pockets of confusion still arise on the difference between them and<a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/what-is-360-video.html" >360 degrees video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Some tend to confuse the two terms while others think they are one and the same thing.</p><p> Below are a few points to help shed more light on the differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Environment</strong></li></ul><p> Virtual reality videos are primarily video generated content where users have the ability to immerse themselves in a virtual world and most of them are video game based. 360 degrees videos on the other hand, are video taken using physical 360 degrees cameras with the same depth as the human eye. This brings about a difference in perception between the 360 degrees video and virtual reality videos.</p><ul><li><strong>Mobility</strong></li></ul><p> Since the virtual reality experience is inspired by video games, users have the liberty to do whatever they want in the virtual environment. With 360 degrees videos however, a camera is placed at a physical location and whatever the user sees is what the filmmaker decided to view. The users don’t have the pleasure of exploring as they feel like as is usually the case with virtual reality videos.</p><ul><li><strong>Timeline</strong></li></ul><p> Unless it is an interactive film, 360 degrees videos will allow the filmmaker to control the story and the timeline of the video. In this sense, 360 degrees videos are immersive whereas the virtual reality videos are interactive with the timeline in VR videos solely on the hands of the viewer.</p><ul><li><strong>Story</strong></li></ul><p> In a virtual reality set up, the viewer or the player leads. This is not the case with 360 degrees videos where the filmmaker has to take control over the narrative and develop it forward. In virtual reality videos, the viewer or the player is experiencing a story happening to them while with the 360 degrees videos, the viewer is experiencing a story happening around them. Additionally, the physical location of the video is even more important in 360 degrees videos as compared to virtual reality videos where the location really is a big factor of consideration.</p><ul><li><strong>Platforms</strong></li></ul><p> For virtual reality experience, the user must have a virtual reality headset which can be tethered to a PC or a mobile device to access the content. 360 degrees video on the other hand doesn’t require any special devices such as VR headsets and are accessible through a variety of compatible players, either through mobile or desktop applications.</p><ul><li><strong>Photography</strong></li></ul><p> For virtual reality, the photography takes place in a digital environment while in 360 degrees videos the action is live in a physical environment with real characters.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075476/7443" target="_top" id="2075476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-watch-Virtual-Realty-video"><a href="#How-to-watch-Virtual-Realty-video" class="headerlink" title="How to watch Virtual Realty video"></a>How to watch Virtual Realty video</h2><p> Related articles:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iPhone Solution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/watch-vr-360-video-on-android.html" >Android Solution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >PC Solution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you own an Android device, then you can easily watch virtual reality videos with the help of Google’s Cardboard. All you have to do is to slot the device into the cheaply made Cardboard viewer and start enjoying the VR experience, though on a lower grade.</p><p> For more enhanced virtual reality experience, you will be required to invest in a decent virtual reality headset which you can then use to get more immersive experiences when watching the content. Depending on the manufacturer of the headset, you may have to connect the headset to a PC - like in the case of the Oculus Rift by Facebook, or the headset may not need any extra addendums to work if you opt for Samsung Gear VR.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145009/26400" target="_top" id="2145009">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2145009" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145009/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Where-to-watch-Virtual-Reality-video"><a href="#Where-to-watch-Virtual-Reality-video" class="headerlink" title="Where to watch Virtual Reality video"></a>Where to watch Virtual Reality video</h2><p> Related article:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Where to Watch VR Content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> There are a variety of places where you can watch a plethora of virtual reality videos. The following are some of the best places to check out if you want to watch virtual reality videos-:</p><ul><li><strong>Virtual Reality via Apps</strong></li></ul><p> The number of apps being designed to for watching virtual reality videos keeps on increasing with each day. Currently, apps such as NYT VR and Vrse are designed to deliver VR-Ready videos which users can access using Google’s Cardboard. It implies that if you have an android device, then you can access these and many other similar virtual reality video apps.</p><ul><li><strong>Virtual Reality videos on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p> YouTube remains the ideal android destination whether you need 360 degrees or VR-primed videos. With the Cardboard, watching virtual reality videos on YouTube becomes so simple and so easy since all you have to do is to load the compatible video on your phone then simply tap on the Cardboard icon will be appearing on the lower right corner of your screen.</p><p> What will happen is that the screen will be split into two nearly identical frames, and when you insert the phone into the cardboard viewer, the images in the two identical frames will merge seamlessly to form one shot.</p><ul><li><strong>Virtual Reality videos locally</strong></li></ul><p> It will also please you to note that you can view virtual reality videos saved locally on your machine, but the experience will not be as good as tapping on the icon on YT. The main reason behind this is that the amount of downloadable virtual reality content is still scarce and firms prefer to make more money by streaming such videos and bookending them with ads instead of making them available as free downloads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134228/18498" target="_top" id="2134228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134228/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-proven-steps-to-convert-webp-to-high-quality-jpeg/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Proven Steps to Convert WebP to High-Quality JPEG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-streamers-dilemma-choosing-between-gopro-and-garmin-virb/"><u>[New] Streamer's Dilemma Choosing Between GoPro & Garmin VIRB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-viral-potential-with-ai-driven-video-titles-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking Viral Potential with AI-Driven Video Titles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-ensuring-your-pictures-endure-top-rated-cloud-storage-services/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Ensuring Your Pictures Endure Top-Rated Cloud Storage Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-quick-guide-installing-and-exploring-ifunnys-meme-app-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Quick Guide Installing & Exploring iFunny's Meme App for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-this-video-will-get-you-100000-views-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] This Video Will Get You 100000 Views on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2023-fix-facebook-videos-not-playing-on-androidiphonechrome/"><u>2023 | Fix Facebook Videos Not Playing on Android/iPhone/Chrome</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/free-electronic-signatures-for-pdf-by-ldigisigner-sign-a-pdf-sign-a-pdf/"><u>Free electronic signatures for PDF</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/1719581835541-french-shades-quickly-say-them-right/"><u>French Shades: Quickly Say Them Right</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-nokia-c22-get-deleted-phone-number-back-with-ease-and-safety-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to Nokia C22 Get Deleted Phone Number Back with Ease and Safety</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-the-security-questions-of-your-apple-id-on-your-apple-iphone-8-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Reset the Security Questions of Your Apple ID On Your Apple iPhone 8 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-six-simple-ways-to-ease-vr-headset-nausea/"><u>In 2024, Six Simple Ways to Ease VR Headset Nausea</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-tips-for-skewing-photo-captions/"><u>In 2024, Tips for Skewing Photo Captions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/week-in-review-atandts-data-leak-exposed-and-samsung-unveils-latest-phone-line-up/"><u>Week in Review: AT&T's Data Leak Exposed & Samsung Unveils Latest Phone Line-Up</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

There are different video shooting modes available. You can choose from super slow-motion, timelapse, and even hyper-lapse. Timelapse is capturing a fixed frame multiple times at regular intervals. Thereafter, the captured frames are compiled in a short video form. The frame rate is set low and the phone camera stays fixed at its position.</p><p>On the other hand, a hyper-lapse is a timelapse where the camera moves. You must have come across videos where timelapse plays for a few seconds. You must have noticed how the timelapse transforms the entire video content immensely. You can accomplish the same with your Samsung time lapse and hyper-lapse feature. We will illustrate how to create timelapse video on Samsung mobile devices.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Timelapse-Video-on-Samsung"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Timelapse-Video-on-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Make a Timelapse Video on Samsung"></a>Part 1. How to Make a Timelapse Video on Samsung</h2><p>Suppose you want to shoot a video of the sunrise or sunset. If you shoot in the regular video mode, the video length will be long. When you play the video, the changes in the movement of the sun will be super slow. That is where timelapse can do wonders. You can shoot a long video by taking photos of the scene at regular intervals.</p><p>When you play the photos in video form, it becomes a very short timelapse video. You can show an hour-long sunrise in a few minutes or seconds. You can create such a timelapse video with your Samsung phone. Here are the steps on how to do time lapse on Samsung mobile device.</p><p>Step1 Open the Camera app on your Samsung device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/open-samsung-camera-app.jpg"                      alt="open samsung camera app"                ></p><p>Step2 When the Camera app opens, go to the bottom of the app screen. You will see different options, and you need to tap on the More option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/tap-more-options-samsung-camera.jpg"                      alt="tap more options samsung camera"                ></p><p>Step3 There is no time lapse in Samsung device. Instead, you have to select the Hyperlapse option to shoot a timelapse video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-hyperlapse-samsung-phone.jpg"                      alt="select hyperlapse samsung phone"                ></p><p>Step4 Place your Samsung device on a tripod and set the video frame perfectly. Thereafter, tap on the Shutter button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-time-lapse-video-samsung.jpg"                      alt="shoot time lapse video samsung"                ></p><p>Step5 You will see a red bar stating the hyper-lapse video duration and the normal video duration. When you want to end shooting the timelapse, tap on the Stop or Shutter button again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135405/19272" target="_top" id="2135405">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135405" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135405/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Related-FAQs-about-Timelapse-on-Samsung"><a href="#Part-2-Related-FAQs-about-Timelapse-on-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Just a single uncontrollable blast of that windy shake can immediately cause a big disturbance in your video footage. If you are a drone lover and often use to record videos in air then it is good to buy Gimbals for your device.

Firstly, the type of motor your gimbal is going to use is extremely important. The drone camera gimbals are usually available in different models and each one of these has unique features. So, if you are thinking to buy a new one then go into following details:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Type of Gimbal</th><th>Axis</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Servo Gimbal</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Light in weight and available with low price range</td><td>Their response time is a big issue</td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Users need not to spend on additional controller board to operate it.</td><td>Most of users stay unsatisfied with its quality.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brushless Gimbal</td><td>2 axis</td><td>Low price and Light weight</td><td>2 axis gimbals are able to stabilize only on roll and pitch axis</td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>You will have to compromise for quality</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#x2F;</td><td>Its horizontal movements are found quite jittery</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3 axis</td><td>Due to presence of yaw it leads to higher stability, quality, pitch as well as roll to stabilize.</td><td>You will find it much heavier; it can affect your flight time.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>There are two radio transmitters: one can control camera and other works for pilot</td><td>You need to spend more.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884021" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884021/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-a-Camera-Gimbal-for-Drones"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-a-Camera-Gimbal-for-Drones" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for a Camera Gimbal for Drones"></a>What to Look for a Camera Gimbal for Drones</h2><h4 id="1-Price"><a href="#1-Price" class="headerlink" title="1. Price"></a>1. Price</h4><p> If you have fewer budgets then you need to plan more wisely for selection of gimbal. Most of the users prefer to buy servo gimbals in such situations as they are least expensive. Although, you may find little disturbance in your video footage but it can definitely meet your basic need for first person view. In case if you have enough savings then professionals suggest to go for brushless gimbals.</p><h4 id="2-Flight-Time"><a href="#2-Flight-Time" class="headerlink" title="2. Flight Time"></a>2. Flight Time</h4><p> Gimbals are going to add some weight to your drone hence they have direct impact on your flight time. Heavy gimbal means lesser flight time so you need to choose accordingly. A 2 axis type gimbal will force you to compromise for quality but it will allow your device to stay in air for longer duration. On the other side, 3 axis gimbals will provide you videos without any unwanted noise but yes they will reduce flight time.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Dones with Longest Flight Time for 2017 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Picture-Quality"><a href="#3-Picture-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3.

Choosing the right one depending on your requirements plays the key role in determining your video capturing success.</p><p> Different Types of Camera Filters and their Uses:</p><p><strong>1. Red Filte:</strong> Works great for shooting in blue water.</p><p> Best Usage: Under natural, surround light in blue water. (no video flash lights)</p><p><strong>2. Magenta Filter:</strong> Necessary for shooting in green water</p><p> Best Usage: Under natural, surround light in green water. (no video flash lights)</p><p><strong>3. Macro Filter:</strong> Very essential for capturing small underwater subjects</p><p> Best Usage 1: Using macro with red filter is great idea so that you can shoot under natural light. (You do not need the video flashlights as the red filter produces the red color effect). You can also use the macro filter only. You can also use the red filter only avoiding the macro lens.<br>Also, check Switchblade- excellent among the GoPro filters for flexible adjustments for everything you need.</p><p> Best Usage 2: Use the macro filter alone with the video lights to achieve clear view of the minute details (maintain medium light availability to control the brightness effect)</p><p> Best Usage 3: Simply use the macro filter alone for topside clear view of small objects</p><p><strong>4. Switchblade 2.0 Filter:</strong> Gives you the facility to use macro and red filter together. You can also flip between red filter for shooting at wide-angle and the macro lens for capturing small subjects.</p><p> Best Usage 1: Use it without using the video lights to capture macro subjects</p><p> Best Usage 2: Disable the ‘fisheye effect’.

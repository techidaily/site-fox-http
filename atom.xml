Are you trying to find out which iPhone apps will equip you with the best photo cropping tools? If you answered affirmative to both of these questions you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to crop photos on your iPhone and we will recommend you several different apps that will make this task smooth and easy.</p><h2 id="How-to-Crop-Photos-on-iPhone"><a href="#How-to-Crop-Photos-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How to Crop Photos on iPhone"></a>How to Crop Photos on iPhone</h2><p> Cropping a photo is one of the most basic photo editing operations and almost all photo editing apps for iPhones provide this option. As a matter of fact, iPhone’s Photo app features the crop tool, which means that you can crop all your photos without ever downloading a photo editing app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-photo-on-iphone.gif"                                     ></p><p> Once you’ve launched the Photos app, select the photo from your camera roll or any other photo album on your iPhone and double tap on it to display it in full screen. Click on the Adjustments icon that is located next to the trash bin at the bottom of your screen, and after the new window opens, tap on the crop icon.</p><p> The crop menu will open and you’ll be offered to choose whether you want to crop your photo manually or if you want to utilize a preset. Presets allow you to automatically convert your pictures into a square or 9:16 aspect ratio, so you can just tap on the option that you find the most helpful at the moment. Once the image is cropped simply click on the Done icon to save the changes you’ve made to your photo.</p><h2 id="Photo-cropping-apps-for-iPhone"><a href="#Photo-cropping-apps-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Photo cropping apps for iPhone"></a>Photo cropping apps for iPhone</h2><p> iPhone owners who’d like to have access to superb photo cropping options and a plethora of powerful photo editing tools should try using some of the apps listed below.</p><h4 id="1-Cropic"><a href="#1-Cropic" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, do you realize that you can use speech-to-text technology in PowerPoint? Yes! It is effortless and fun-filled: dictate, and create presentable slides with your speech. What is more fun than speaking and seeing your speech in electronic formats? This article teaches how you can create presentations via speech-to-text technology and how you can use real-time translation in PowerPoint.</p><p><strong>Best Speech-To-Text Software</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text to make perfect PPT videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?</h2><p>Using speech-to-text in PowerPoint is the same principle guiding other platforms like Microsoft Words. Also, PowerPoint presentation on a windows device is similar to a Mac. However, some control and key functions differ in the two devices. The only thing you should note when you want to use the speech-to-text function is the type of device you are using. You can enable “speech-to-text” on devices like Mac, Windows, and mobile phones.</p><p>Please note that “enabling speech-to-text” in PowerPoint differs from “using speech-to-text.” For example, you have to enable the speech-to-text first before you can use it. Also, how you enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint is based on the selected devices. Let’s discuss enabling speech-to-text on Mac and Windows.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Mac"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Mac</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Select the control button:</strong> Mac allows you to select the control button for activating speech-to-text the first time you want to use the feature. Unlike other devices, the control option pops up when you select the speech-to-text option. It then displays some control options so that you can select the button suitable for you.</li><li><strong>Activate the feature:</strong> click on the apple logo on your Mac, and select <strong>“system preference.”</strong> Select <strong>“keyboard”</strong> options displayed in the system preference.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-1.jpg"                      alt="click on the apple logo"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Select the dictation option:</strong> select dictation from the keyboard option and check the <strong>“on&#x2F;off”</strong> The option also has an advanced feature that allows additional commands.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-2.jpg"                      alt="select the dictation option"                ></p><p>Once you activate the dictation from the command button, you can use the speech-to-text feature anywhere you can type on Mac - this applies to PowerPoint. However, you may need some tweaking on PowerPoint to finally use the feature as you prepare your slides.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Windows"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Windows</strong></h3><p>Aside from the regular Cortana speech recognition on Windows, you can use the speech-to-text feature on PowerPoint. PowerPoint supports “speech-to-text” when you use the program; however, activating the Windows device through the <strong>built-in speech recognition</strong> makes the process easy and effective. Some windows PC, just like Mac, lets you first activate the speech recognition function before you proceed and use it on PowerPoint.</p><ul><li>On PowerPoint, click on the microphone icon on the left corner of your PowerPoint’s homepage. If the speech-to-text feature is not activated on your device, you can follow the instruction to activate it.

There are cases you need to activate speech-to-text in a life event. PowerPoint supports this through the “speech-to-text” feature available on the platform.</p><h3 id="Set-up-captions-and-subtitles"><a href="#Set-up-captions-and-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Set up captions and subtitles"></a><strong>Set up captions and subtitles</strong></h3><p>Real-time display and translation are suitable for the multi-language purpose. You can select the real-time option on your PowerPoint and makes it display another subtitle in other languages. Thus, when you speak in a language, the captions or subtitles display another text (speech-to-text) in a different language.</p><ul><li>Click on the <strong>slide show</strong>, and go to <strong>subtitle settings</strong>; select <strong>spoken languages.</strong> The spoken language is the “speech input language”: the language you will speak to be translated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-8.jpg"                      alt="click on the slide show"                ></p><ul><li>After setting the spoken language, move on to set the <strong>subtitle&#x2F;caption language.</strong> The subtitle or caption language is the translated language. PowerPoint allows you to translate speech without using an application. You can make a multi-language selection without much involvement - just settings.</li></ul><p><strong>Tips:</strong> Many options are available for easy use and accessibility. Aside from the multi-language selection, you can explore the “slide show” settings for better understanding. You may see other options that best illustrate your need for translation in real-time on PowerPoint.</p><p>When you activate the real-time translation on PowerPoint, the settings occur in two stages: slideshow view and presenter view. You can vary the changes based on your view (as the presenter) or what people see (slideshow view).</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos"></a>Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos</h2><p>When you want to make perfect PPT videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora version 13.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Use-Filmora-STT-to-make-PowerPoint-videos-translation"><a href="#Use-Filmora-STT-to-make-PowerPoint-videos-translation" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora STT to make PowerPoint videos translation"></a>Use Filmora STT to make PowerPoint videos translation</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening! Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do"><a href="#When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do" class="headerlink" title="When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?"></a>When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?</h2><p>You do not need to dedicate a specific time to listen to podcasts. The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging"><a href="#2-Jogging" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="3-Fishing"><a href="#3-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage. It is to be noted that you can also listen to podcast episodes while managing your mail, scrolling through social media pages, or editing photos.</p><h3 id="5-Cook-a-meal"><a href="#5-Cook-a-meal" class="headerlink" title="5. Cook a meal"></a>5. Cook a meal</h3><p>Do you cook daily? Or maybe once or twice a week? Well, you can tune into your favorite episodes and cook. The best thing is if you are interested in cooking podcasts, then it is a perfect combination. Nevertheless, even if you follow podcasts discussing astronomy or rocket science, cooking is one of the best things to do while listening to podcasts, it saves time, and you also enjoy a healthy and delicious meal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-6.jpg"                      alt="cooking podcast"                ></p><p>Chopping vegetables or meat, the washing process, and food preparation are some activities that consume a lot of time of people, so filling this with information-rich podcasts is a good substitute for your time.</p><h3 id="6-Driving"><a href="#6-Driving" class="headerlink" title="6. Driving"></a>6. Driving</h3><p>Driving to work and from work takes a lot of time, and you often get tired of being in the car. It is best to substitute this time with your favorite podcasts daily. This way, you will be able to make the most of the time that you waste daily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-7.jpg"                      alt="drive podcast"                ></p><p>It is important to retain that information-filled podcasts often grab all your attention, so you might focus on something other than driving itself. So, ensure that you know your routes well and listen to causal podcasts you can divert from while driving on the roads. It is best to listen to podcasts with a friend or colleague, as podcasts at such times create a perfect ebb and flow throughout the drive.</p><h3 id="7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry"><a href="#7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry" class="headerlink" title="7. Do laundry or Fold laundry"></a>7. Do laundry or Fold laundry</h3><p>Laundry can be frustrating; it is a hurtful process that even a laundry enthusiast hates to do. It’s time-consuming, unceasing, and seems like a never-ending process you do not want to engage in.</p><p>However, podcasts are made for such times and hurtful tasks like doing laundry or folding laundry. You can grab your headphones and tune in to your favorite podcast episode, making doing laundry an information-filled session and more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="laundry podcast"                ></p><p>Better yet, swift to hand-laundering. Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories. Sometimes, hand-laundering is necessary; for instance, if you have to wash an expensive garment or want to avoid going to the laundromat, combine the entire process with your favorite podcast playing in your ears.</p><h3 id="8-Gardening"><a href="#8-Gardening" class="headerlink" title="8. Gardening"></a>8. Gardening</h3><p>Gardening is a set of activities that often are mindless. Additionally, this is one of those activities you often have to turn to every week to ensure your plants are growing normally. You can perfectly fill these activities by tuning a podcast and making the most of your time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="gardening podcast"                ></p><p>Basically, if you are thinking about all the stuff to do while listening to podcasts, compile a list of mindless activities you regularly engage in and see if you can substitute such activities; in this case, gardening with podcasts should feel comfortable to you.</p><p>For instance, if you cannot focus on both, then it is best not to chase two rabbits simultaneously. The process only works if you can combine both tasks without compromising on one.</p><h3 id="9-Walk-the-dog"><a href="#9-Walk-the-dog" class="headerlink" title="9. Walk the dog"></a>9. Walk the dog</h3><p>Walking the dog is a meditative process. It’s about appreciating the surroundings, reconnecting with nature, and bonding with our four-legged friend while roaming the city’s surroundings.</p><p>However, listening to podcasts while walking your dog can also be a new experience. Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes" class="headerlink" title="10. Do the Dishes"></a>10. Do the Dishes</h3><p>If we have to inform this, it means you are not having fun while doing the dishes. Doing dishes is one of the chores which you should take as a challenge and make really fun. The fun could be of different types, like timing yourself or racing with someone else. In this case, you can play your favorite podcast episodes and listen to them daily while doing the dishes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="dishes podcast"                ></p><p>The fun, the learning, and the sense of doing something different hits differently when you combine podcasts with doing dishes; not to forget, you made something of the time that you hate the most of your day.</p><h3 id="11-Paint-your-nails"><a href="#11-Paint-your-nails" class="headerlink" title="11. Paint your nails"></a>11. Paint your nails</h3><p>Painting nails is once again one of those processes that are initially elegant and important for girls. However, the waiting time while you are drying out the nail polish is the worst. However, doing something fun like playing your high-beat music with dancing as you’ve never danced before takes you into an astral world and allows you to experience a different side of yourself. This time, however, try playing the newest episode from your favorite podcast. And note down your experience once you complete it.</p><h3 id="12-Take-a-bath"><a href="#12-Take-a-bath" class="headerlink" title="12. Take a bath"></a>12. Take a bath</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="taking a bath podcast"                ></p><p>Many people take baths for granted. It is one of the best ways to reset, relax, and recharge yourself after a tiresome day. You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><h3 id="13-Commute"><a href="#13-Commute" class="headerlink" title="13. Commute"></a>13. Commute</h3><p>Daily commutes occupy a large part of everyone’s day. Yes, the work from home is becoming a reality. But that reality is still far in the future. Until then, you have to commute to work, children to school, groceries, and so on. Well, you can fill these times with information-rich podcasts and learn new things.</p><p>It sounds like you might not focus and listen to the podcast like you would at home. But you’ll be amazed at how well you can adapt podcast listening while commuting in a bus or train filled with people.</p><h3 id="14-Clean-the-house"><a href="#14-Clean-the-house" class="headerlink" title="14. Clean the house"></a>14. Clean the house</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-12.jpg"                      alt="clean the house podcast"                ></p><p>Again, it all comes down to making a daunting task like cleaning the house fun and entertaining. If you truly enjoy listening to the podcast, play it on your home theatre and listen to the episodes as you clean your house.</p><p>Most people ignore these beautiful tasks of the day, thinking they will be wasting their time, and often hire a housemaid. But that’s the beauty of the modern world; you can make these tasks fun and entertaining if only complemented with the right podcasts or music.</p><h3 id="15-Haircut-or-hair-dye"><a href="#15-Haircut-or-hair-dye" class="headerlink" title="15. Haircut or hair dye"></a>15. Haircut or hair dye</h3><p>A haircut is a time that you give to your barber. It is all about sitting on the chair and letting the masters do their work. And putting on earphones for listening to music and podcast can be disastrous, as one snip and your costly earphones will be gone for good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-13.jpg"                      alt="haircut podcast"                ></p><p>However, you can make the time of everyone sitting at the saloon beautiful by simply asking the barber to play one of the podcasts they like or you like. This will also allow you to experience new podcasts you aren’t familiar with and initiate a good conversation with your client.</p><h2 id="Summing-up"><a href="#Summing-up" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h2><p>The above list of things to do while listening to podcasts is all about acquainting you with tedious tasks and making them beautiful.</p><p>As mentioned, you can complement a podcast episode with any boring task you have to do daily and make your time most effective and fun.</p><p>Overall, there are too many mindless things that you have to do daily; simply remember to carry your earphones and make that mindless activity into a beautiful, fun, and informative session.</p><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea.

And as we all know, digital cameras can only capture images with differentiation in a specific range of luminosity.</p><p>You need reliable HDR software to be able to create HDR images. Luminance HDR is one of the top software that many people want to have at their fingertips. But is the tool worth it? Does it have all it takes to satisfy your HDR image creation and editing needs?

The creation and tone mapping of HDR images are interactive using GUI, and images can be enhanced using quality features. The image loading speed is quite fair. So, in all, we could say the Luminance HDR processing is reliable.</p><ol><li>UI and Layout</li></ol><p>The Luminous HDR interface is fairly responsive, but some of the features are quite confusing, making it challenging.

Popular platforms linked to the OBS Streamlabs Mac are Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Mixer, and any other desirable streaming option. The possibilities are limitless. Surely, with this new development, OBS Streamlabs Mac can match close competitors such as the original OBS, ECamm live, and Twitch Studios.</p><p>Subsequently, we will go through the workings of the OBS Streamlabs Mac from download and onwards but, first, it is important to know all about this brilliant Open Broadcast Software and what makes it endearing.</p><h2 id="Streamlabs-OBS-vs-OBS"><a href="#Streamlabs-OBS-vs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Streamlabs OBS vs OBS"></a>Streamlabs OBS vs OBS</h2><p>The generic OBS is a software put out to the general public to enable streaming in its simplest and unmodified form. For an individual that just wants to stream videos without colorfulness, effects, and additional features, the OBS is perfect.</p><p>However, Streamlabs OBS is improved. Known as SLOBS to its increasing subscribers, Streamlabs OBS enhances user experience and provides a collection of tools to do so in one hub, with no outsourcing.</p><ul><li>OBS (Open Broadcaster Studio)</li></ul><p>It is free and open-source, the code is ‘naked’ to the public. At will, developers can improve on the software. Manual connection to Twitch, YouTube, and the likes is also possible. A few settings here and there and you are set!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>OBS gives a wonderful experience to users albeit with its inefficiencies in providing added features and functions. It is seamless as far as primary recording and broadcasting are concerned, leaving out the extras.</p><p>There are overlays and background designs available on OBS for a price although limited. Largely, users will need to consult other websites—copy and paste—to have varied layout options. It is not much work, however; there are many such websites.</p><ul><li>Streamlabs OBS</li></ul><p>This is an example of when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Streamlabs saw an opportunity with the original OBS and like any other developer, modified it. They have forged on everyone till this OBS Streamlab Mac version. The code was revamped to guarantee an improved user experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/STREAMLABS-OBS.jpg"                      alt="STREAMLABS OBS"                ></p><p>Like OBS, OBS Streamlabs Mac is free with a relatively easier installation process. Preceding the OBS Streamlabs Mac, it was available only on Windows and had app versions on Android and iOS. Notwithstanding, through Bootcamp, Mac owners could switch operating systems and use StreamLabs OBS.</p><p>In a blink, all settings are pre-configured and subscribers are directed to the Dashboard where major choices are made. After a few clicks, you are set to stream.</p><p>OBS Streamlabs Mac’s enhanced experience is by far unmatched by any other of its kind. An array of themes and advanced features allows each user to create his world through personalized—unique—layouts.</p><p>Exclusively, OBS Streamlab Mac provides alerts, text-to-speech automation, widgets, and layouts for free.</p><h2 id="Steps-to-Download-Streamlabs-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#Steps-to-Download-Streamlabs-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Download Streamlabs OBS on Mac"></a>Steps to Download Streamlabs OBS on Mac</h2><p>Here are the easy steps to get OBS Streamlabs Mac working on your computer.</p><h3 id="1-Download-Streamlabs-OBS"><a href="#1-Download-Streamlabs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s up to you to decide everything about the podcast, like the episode’s length, topics, and more.</p><p>In this article, we’ll break down some of the things you want to consider before starting your solo podcast, so stick to the end.</p><ol><li><a href="#part5-1">The Rob Auton Daily</a></li><li><a href="#part5-2">You Must Remember This</a></li><li><a href="#part5-3">Live From the 405</a></li><li><a href="#part5-4">Have You Heard George’s Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part5-5">Casefile True Crime</a></li><li><a href="#part5-6">This American Life</a></li><li><a href="#part5-7">WTF with Marc Maron</a></li><li><a href="#part5-8">Reply All</a></li><li><a href="#part5-9">The Lazy Genius Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part5-10">Say Your Mind</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Solo-Podcasting"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Solo-Podcasting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

It’s a chance to express yourself, a platform to share your ideas and thoughts with people. Also, to show people who you are and what you’re about—the beauty of solo podcasting. You are free, and it’s a great feeling. The idea is simple: You are the protagonist of your own story.</p><h3 id="Go-at-your-own-pace"><a href="#Go-at-your-own-pace" class="headerlink" title="Go at your own pace"></a>Go at your own pace</h3><p>Working on your own gives flexibility with working hours you wouldn’t get as part of a team. That means you can work at your own pace and not feel pressured by a deadline or fear failing since knowing no one but yourself is listening.</p><p>It also means you can work at your own pace as a podcast host without waiting for your audience to be ready.</p><h3 id="Content-is-totally-under-your-control"><a href="#Content-is-totally-under-your-control" class="headerlink" title="Content is totally under your control"></a>Content is totally under your control</h3><p>You’re always controlling your content while working in a solo podcaster scenario. No one else tells you what to say; no one tells you how to say it.</p><p>The upside is that you don’t have to worry about getting your ideas “out there,” which allows you to be creative.No but yourself can dictate the tone of your show.</p><p>Solo podcasters don’t have anyone else to compete with, and they get to choose what they talk about. You’re in full control over everything, which means no advertisers or sponsors are dictating your message.</p><p>That means you can ensure that you deliver a compelling story that people want to hear.</p><h3 id="Post-Production-is-Easier"><a href="#Post-Production-is-Easier" class="headerlink" title="Post-Production is Easier"></a>Post-Production is Easier</h3><p>When you work alone, you can take time to make changes or re-edits. Post-production is also easier to deal with if you don’t have the pressure to deliver something at a certain time.</p><h3 id="Connect-with-Your-Audience-on-a-Deeper-Level"><a href="#Connect-with-Your-Audience-on-a-Deeper-Level" class="headerlink" title="Connect with Your Audience on a Deeper Level"></a>Connect with Your Audience on a Deeper Level</h3><p>Solo podcasting is one of the most efficient ways to build relationships with your audience and connect with them deeper.</p><p>When you’re just starting, your audiences don’t know who you are. So you’ll likely struggle to connect with them on a personal level. But By developing a solo podcast, you allow yourself to develop a personal brand while building a network of people who share your same passion and interests.</p><p>Keep your content focused on your unique story, and be as transparent as possible when you get started. Most listeners prefer to connect with the hosts they find on podcasts than on other media, And Solo Podcast listeners trust their hosts as experts on their topics.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Bang-Up-Solo-Podcast"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Bang-Up-Solo-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Make a Bang-Up Solo Podcast"></a>Part 2. How to Make a Bang-Up Solo Podcast</h2><p>Now, we are going to look into the ins and outs of creating a Bang-Up Solo Podcast that would grab your viewers’ maximum attention. But first, we must share something interesting in a way that they understand, And this is what will make your podcast an excellent solo podcast.</p><h3 id="A-list-of-solo-episode-topics"><a href="#A-list-of-solo-episode-topics" class="headerlink" title="A list of solo episode topics"></a>A list of solo episode topics</h3><p>First, while working on the episode, we must remember that connecting audience with your subject matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-2.jpg"                      alt="podcast episode list to talk about"                ></p><p>For example, if you’re a musician who wants to share insights on improving your songwriting craft, you may need to focus on it. Secondly, before creating an episode, our Listeners may want to hear the story behind the product, so it’s helpful to explain why you built it, what your goals were, what you learned, what you got done, and how the product has evolved.</p><p>It will help you give clear instructions for deciding on solo episode topics that are creative, unique, helpful &amp; engaging to share.</p><h3 id="An-outline-for-an-episode"><a href="#An-outline-for-an-episode" class="headerlink" title="An outline for an episode"></a>An outline for an episode</h3><p>One common mistake when creating a podcast is jumping into it without a plan. Therefore it’s important to have some roadmap for your episode before you even begin working on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-3.jpg"                      alt="podcast outline"                ></p><p>An outline for a good episode usually includes an introduction&#x2F;promo, the main topic, a break, a conclusion, and a wrap-up.

We all make mistakes. And when we do, we learn. So don’t stress out over your first podcast. Instead, take notes after each episode and use those as your learning curve. You don’t need to be perfect from the very beginning.</p><h3 id="Practice"><a href="#Practice" class="headerlink" title="Practice"></a>Practice</h3><p>It takes some practice to get the natural flow of conversation going. We recommend practicing speaking in front of a mirror to ensure you sound confident and natural. Once you’ve practiced enough, record yourself, listen back, and play it to see where you’re strong and where you need to improve.</p><h3 id="Stand-a-point"><a href="#Stand-a-point" class="headerlink" title="Stand a point"></a>Stand a point</h3><p>A key part of being a successful podcast host is sticking to your bullet points.

You need at least 30 minutes of material for your episode, or you risk alienating listeners and driving them away from your brand.</p><p>You’ll lose listeners’ attention if you don’t know what to say during your episode. So instead, think of your podcast as a mini-publication. You can get away with making shorter episodes because you can fill more content into your episodes.</p><h3 id="Recap-the-episode-1"><a href="#Recap-the-episode-1" class="headerlink" title="Recap the episode"></a>Recap the episode</h3><p>Recapping the previous episode is a great way to start your podcast. Doing so allows your listeners to quickly catch up while at the same time giving you a chance to share the most relevant information from the last show.</p><p>That way, when the next podcast episode starts, your listeners will already be up-to-date on essential information.</p><h3 id="The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing-1"><a href="#The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing-1" class="headerlink" title="The right tool for recording and editing"></a>The right tool for recording and editing</h3><p>As the popularity of podcasts continues to grow, so does the need for quality, professional sound recordings and editing tools.</p><p>If you’re a podcaster looking to record and edit, Wondershare Filmora must be your priority.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-4.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>For those who would like to produce podcasts or videos on the go, Wondershare Filmora is not only an easy-to-use video editing software but also a good helper for podcast editing.</p><ul><li>Speech-to-text allows smooth conversion of voiceover to text, making your podcasts more accessible.</li><li>Over 2000+ audio resources range from music, audio effects and much more.</li><li>Remove background noise, fade in, fade out, and do lots more audio editing without hassles.</li><li>Supports many shortcut key commands to help tech-savvy and non-tec-savvy individuals to create and edit podcasts quickly.</li><li>Audio Ducking to easily eliminate background noise and unwanted sound recorded while creating podcasts.</li></ul><p>You can export your episodes as MP3 files, which can then be uploaded to any podcast hosting site like iTunes, Podomatic, and Libsyn.

Tips &amp; Takeaways for Solo Podcasting"></a>Part 3. Tips &amp; Takeaways for Solo Podcasting</h2><p>The world of podcasts is changing, so how can podcasters succeed when there’s so much competition? We asked three podcasters how to get started, who have grown as solo podcasters. Here are their top tips and lessons, plus advice from fellow podcasters.</p><h3 id="Don’t-worry-about-mistakes-1"><a href="#Don’t-worry-about-mistakes-1" class="headerlink" title="Don’t worry about mistakes"></a>Don’t worry about mistakes</h3><p>The first tip for solo podcasters is to not worry about making mistakes. We all make mistakes. And when we do, we learn. So don’t stress out over your first podcast. Instead, take notes after each episode and use those as your learning curve. You don’t need to be perfect from the very beginning.</p><h3 id="Practice-1"><a href="#Practice-1" class="headerlink" title="Practice"></a>Practice</h3><p>It takes some practice to get the natural flow of conversation going. We recommend practicing speaking in front of a mirror to ensure you sound confident and natural. Once you’ve practiced enough, record yourself, listen back, and play it to see where you’re strong and where you need to improve.</p><h3 id="Stand-a-point-1"><a href="#Stand-a-point-1" class="headerlink" title="Stand a point"></a>Stand a point</h3><p>A key part of being a successful podcast host is sticking to your bullet points. While the show is running, there’s no time for you to ramble, so your goal is to make sure you hit all your points and move on quickly.</p><h3 id="Have-fun-1"><a href="#Have-fun-1" class="headerlink" title="Have fun"></a>Have fun</h3><p>Having fun doesn’t mean that you’re doing something wrong. But it does mean relaxing. You’re doing something right. People are more likely to listen if they know you’re having fun while you talk. On the other hand, if you take yourself too seriously, people will tune out.</p><h2 id="Part-4-The-challenges-of-making-solo-podcasting-1"><a href="#Part-4-The-challenges-of-making-solo-podcasting-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. The challenges of making solo podcasting"></a>Part 4. The challenges of making solo podcasting</h2><p>If you’re working on a podcast as a solo podcast host, you need to figure out where to find guests, approach them, and create a rapport with your listeners. The challenges of making solo podcasting are many. Whether you make music or talk about your favourite hobby or sport, someone is likely there who can help you.</p><h3 id="No-one-to-share-the-workload-1"><a href="#No-one-to-share-the-workload-1" class="headerlink" title="No one to share the workload"></a>No one to share the workload</h3><p>There’s no denying it, being a solo podcast host is hard work. There’s no one to take over if you fall behind schedule or have a day off. Being a solo podcast host takes a lot of time and energy, and you don’t get a choice.</p><p>Even if you manage to pull it off, some people don’t like your podcast and have nothing but negative things to say about you. Preparing for this every time you create a new episode would be best. Therefore You need to have someone to take over when you fall.</p><h3 id="Harder-to-stay-motivated-1"><a href="#Harder-to-stay-motivated-1" class="headerlink" title="Harder to stay motivated"></a>Harder to stay motivated</h3><p>The problem with solo podcasts is that there is no built-in motivation. You must do it because you enjoy it or hope it will help someone else. There’s no intrinsic reason to do it. That said, the biggest problem with making solo podcasts is that it becomes harder and harder to stay motivated to keep making episodes.</p><h3 id="Harder-to-deliver-a-Montage-1"><a href="#Harder-to-deliver-a-Montage-1" class="headerlink" title="Harder to deliver a Montage"></a>Harder to deliver a Montage</h3><p>If your podcast is mostly monologue or narration, and you don’t do any interviews or interviews with yourself, you will feel like a hamster in a wheel with no release.</p><p>To deliver a montage effectively, you must first create a soundtrack of voiceover audio in your mind. It would be best to hear it repeatedly until you’ve committed the track to memory. Once you have that, you must record the monologue audio and edit it into a montage.</p><h2 id="Part-5-The-Best-10-Solo-Podcasts-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-5-The-Best-10-Solo-Podcasts-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

But note that you will need huge storage capacity to work with all advanced features of this camera so here is a need to go through available memory cards. Note that Sony A7S II is highly dependent upon type of memory card and when it find that memory card is not meeting desired requirements then card type it simply disables few important features. It is good to ensure that you have bought right card so that your camera can function properly.</p><p> The article below can help you to select right memory cards for your Sony A7S II camera:</p><h2 id="How-to-choose-the-right-memory-card-for-your-Sony-A7S-II"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-memory-card-for-your-Sony-A7S-II" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right memory card for your Sony A7S II"></a>How to choose the right memory card for your Sony A7S II</h2><h4 id="Section-1-UHS-Ultra-High-Speed-Card-Classification"><a href="#Section-1-UHS-Ultra-High-Speed-Card-Classification" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: UHS (Ultra High Speed) Card Classification"></a>Section 1: UHS (Ultra High Speed) Card Classification</h4><p> You will find few memory cards with Ultra High Speed (UHS) classifications that determine maximum reading speed of your card. Presently, you can find two major types of UHS classifications as UHS-I and USH-II where the first one is rated to serve at 104MB&#x2F;s and second one serves at 312 MB&#x2F;s. It simply means that footage in USH-II cards can be offloaded 3x faster but to maintain this speed you need to have a fast connection and fast hard drive.</p><h4 id="Section-2-Requirements-for-Sony-A7S-II-Memory-Card"><a href="#Section-2-Requirements-for-Sony-A7S-II-Memory-Card" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Requirements for Sony A7S II Memory Card"></a>Section 2: Requirements for Sony A7S II Memory Card</h4><h4 id="1-Card-Type-SDXC"><a href="#1-Card-Type-SDXC" class="headerlink" title="1. Card Type: SDXC"></a>1. Card Type: SDXC</h4><p> The SDXC card technology was launched in 2010 to serve the requirements of full HD recordings with higher speed and capacity. However, these cards follow dimensions comparable to SD as well as SDHC cards but they can support only SDXC devices. You can find these cards ranging from 64GB memory capacity to 2TB and the speed variation goes from 104MB&#x2F;s to 300MB&#x2F;s respectively.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>These cards provide higher storage capacities ranging between 64GB to 2TB.</li><li>Its exFAT type file support allows users to work with large files with higher bitrates.</li></ul><h4 id="2-Speed-Class-Rating-U3"><a href="#2-Speed-Class-Rating-U3" class="headerlink" title="2. Speed Class Rating: U3"></a>2. Speed Class Rating: U3</h4><p> Some of the common specifications that manufacturers provide with their cards are write speed limits and burst read details but both of these cannot help user to get right card for their 4K video needs. Actually the ratio between burst rate and speed does not follow a simple relation thus the best idea is to buy cards by checking their speed class rating. This speed class rating shows that your card will not reduce its writing speed below the specified speed class limit. Some of the most popular peed class ratings available in market are Class 10, U3, U1, Class 6 and Class 4.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>The U3 or UHS speed class 3 cards are designed to serve compatible speed rates for A7S II cameras.</li><li>They can maintain minimum write speed value of 30MB&#x2F;s.</li><li>These cards can record details very smoothly without missing any frame in between.</li></ul><h4 id="3-Card-Capacity"><a href="#3-Card-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="3. Card Capacity"></a>3. Card Capacity</h4><p> As advanced 4k recording cameras like A7S II are designed to work with high capacity cards so the best idea is to buy a card with 64GB capacity so that all frames can be processed without any loss in information. In order to get best results for your classic 4k recordings always prefer to pick a card with higher rating. When you buy a card with higher capacity:</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>You will be able to minimize the risks of sudden card failures. Because when cards are not able to support higher bitrates then they often lose most of the information. It is good to choose a card that can easily record footage up to 1 or 2 hours.</li><li>Note that there is no money saving deal in memory card price ranges. When you go to buy a 128GB memory card it will naturally cost same as if you buy two 64GB cards.</li><li>The SD cards are small sized, compact units so whether you carry a 64GB card in your pocket or choose a 128GB package, none of these are going to put additional weight on your pocket.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Memory-Cards-for-Sony-A7S-II"><a href="#Best-Memory-Cards-for-Sony-A7S-II" class="headerlink" title="Best Memory Cards for Sony A7S II"></a>Best Memory Cards for Sony A7S II</h2><h4 id="1-Sony-64GB-High-Performance-Class-10-UHS-1-U3-SDXC"><a href="#1-Sony-64GB-High-Performance-Class-10-UHS-1-U3-SDXC" class="headerlink" title="1. Sony 64GB High Performance Class 10 UHS-1&#x2F;U3 SDXC"></a>1. Sony 64GB High Performance Class 10 UHS-1&#x2F;U3 SDXC</h4><p> The Class 10 cards offer high capacity and high speed processing for 4K videos and stills so they are mostly recommended to work with DSLR cameras. They provide write speed rating of 90MB&#x2F;s whereas transfer speed goes up to 95MB&#x2F;s.</p><ul><li>Well known for high speed performance with extended support to capture 240 HD photos&#x2F;minute.</li><li>Ensures fast data transfer services.</li><li>They support 4K recordings.</li><li>Comes with data recovery softwares so that you can get back your lost files immediately.</li></ul><h4 id="2-Transcend-64GB-U3-SDXC-Card"><a href="#2-Transcend-64GB-U3-SDXC-Card" class="headerlink" title="2. Transcend 64GB U3 SDXC Card"></a>2. Transcend 64GB U3 SDXC Card</h4><p> It is one of the best recommendations for high quality video recordings. These cards can work in flow with many big brands while ensuring higher reliability even with lower price range. Most of the professionals love to use Transcend cards for HD and 4K recording needs.</p><ul><li>They offer write speed up to 40MB&#x2F;s and Read capacity of 60MB&#x2F;s.</li><li>Works with error correction mechanism for ensuring higher reliability.</li><li>Higher durability.</li><li>Suitable for HD camcorders and DSLR cameras.</li></ul><h4 id="3-SanDisk-Extreme-64GB-U3-SDXC-Card"><a href="#3-SanDisk-Extreme-64GB-U3-SDXC-Card" class="headerlink" title="3.

GIFs are better alternatives for users who want to send more realistic reaction icons. Do you want to turn a GIF file you saved on your mobile phone into an animated sticker? Well, it is extremely easy, but you have to rely on a third-party app.</p><h2 id="How-Do-I-Turn-a-GIF-into-a-Sticker"><a href="#How-Do-I-Turn-a-GIF-into-a-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Turn a GIF into a Sticker?"></a>How Do I Turn a GIF into a Sticker?</h2><p>It is possible to use a <strong>GIF to sticker converter</strong> to change the GIF format files into stickers. One suitable tool here is the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/" >Wondershare UniConverter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The software, available for both Mac and Windows devices, is suitable for creating GIFs and stickers alike. You can adjust the output size and framerate and transform the GIF file you create further into sticker-appropriate WebP format.</p><p>Furthermore, you can choose to store this in your device or cloud memory, as necessary. Follow the steps below to turn your GIFs into stickers at ease.</p><p>Step1 Install the Wondershare Unicoverter on your PC or Mac.</p><p>Step2 You should click on the “<strong>Tools</strong>“ tab after launching the software on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-1.jpg"                      alt="click on tools"                ></p><p>Step3 Under this, choose the “<strong>GIF Maker</strong>” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-2.jpg"                      alt="choose gif maker option"                ></p><p>Step4 Select the side for “<strong>Photos to GIF</strong>” on the next window that appears to add your image and “<strong>Videos to GIF</strong>” for a video file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-3.jpg"                      alt="select the side for photos to gif"                ></p><p>Step5 Add the image&#x2F;video clip after clicking on the “<strong>Add</strong>” button.</p><p>Step6 Make changes to the Output parameters and Frame Rate, and click on the “<strong>Create GIF</strong>” button.</p><p>Step7 After creating the GIF, go to the UniConverter home page again and click on “<strong>Image Converter</strong>“.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-4.jpg"                      alt="click on image converter"                ></p><p>Step8 Choose the conversion model to WEBP and click the <strong>tickbox</strong> for the File.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-5.jpg"                      alt="choose conversion model to webp"                ></p><p>Step9 Press the Convert button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-6.jpg"                      alt="press the convert button"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-convert-a-GIF-to-a-Discord-sticker"><a href="#How-to-convert-a-GIF-to-a-Discord-sticker" class="headerlink" title="How to convert a GIF to a Discord sticker?"></a>How to convert a GIF to a Discord sticker?</h2><p>There are tools available for users to convert GIFs to stickers specifically for communication&#x2F;streaming-based platforms like Discord. The process of using UniConverter would not work here, though, since the supported format for stickers is APNG. That is not available under this software at this point.</p><p>It would help if you used an online tool for GIF to APNG conversion, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.aconvert.com/image/gif-to-apng/" >AConvert.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step1 Open the online tool on your browser, and click on <strong>File</strong> to choose the source location type.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-7.jpg"                      alt="click on files"                ></p><p>Step2 Tap the “<strong>Choose File</strong>” option and add the main GIF you want to convert from your device&#x2F;cloud. Bottom of Form</p><p>Step3 Choose the Output format as APNG. Set the image size and quality specifications.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-8.jpg"                      alt="choose output format as apng"                ></p><p>Step4 Click on the “<strong>Convert Now</strong>“ button. The File would store on your device, and you can use it on Discord as stickers.</p><h2 id="How-to-put-your-GIFs-into-animated-WhatsApp-stickers"><a href="#How-to-put-your-GIFs-into-animated-WhatsApp-stickers" class="headerlink" title="How to put your GIFs into animated WhatsApp stickers?"></a>How to put your GIFs into animated WhatsApp stickers?</h2><p>Much like the process of converting GIF to stickers using the regular UniConverter tool, you can also use that or other apps to prepare GIFs for WhatsApp-based stickers. In this case, ensure the <strong>gif to sticker WhatsApp</strong> aspect ratio settings are set to 512 x 512 pixels since that is what the app supports. However, this would help create some standard-level stickers mainly.</p><p>Step1 Open your WhatsApp application on the phone and access the chat of the person you would send it to.</p><p>Step2 Click on the paperclip or media icon and insert the video on your device through that section. Alternatively, you can click on the camera to directly record a video using the slider icon above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-9.jpg"                      alt="click on paperclip or media"                ></p><p>Keep the video around 6 seconds long. If it extends further, cut it to 6 seconds maximum.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-10.jpg"                      alt="keep the video around 6seconds long"                ></p><p>Step3 You can add stickers, icons, or text to the video.</p><p>Step4 There is a GIF icon beside the video option. Click on it and press the “<strong>Send</strong>” button to your contact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gif-to-sticker-11.jpg"                      alt="click on gif icon"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-turn-a-GIF-to-a-Telegram-sticker"><a href="#How-to-turn-a-GIF-to-a-Telegram-sticker" class="headerlink" title="How to turn a GIF to a Telegram sticker?"></a>How to turn a GIF to a Telegram sticker?</h2><p>You can use either the Uniconverter or AConvert tool to turn your image&#x2F;video into a GIF file. For sharing on Telegram, you have to use the same process through UniConverter’s Image Converter to change the images into 512 x 512-pixel dimensions. Then, add the pack in Telegram as a new sticker pack.</p><p>Step1 Access the Telegram app through the PC and open the chatbot function for Sticker through Search. The ID here is @Stickers.</p><p>Step2 Open the chat, type &#x2F;newpack.Press the Enter button. Again, give a name to the sticker pack and click on Enter.</p><p>Step3 Click on the File icon and add the GIF file from your device.</p><p>Step4 Assign a relatable emoji with the File and press Enter. Do the same for all files.</p><p>Step5 Add all stickers and type &#x2F;publish.

The holodeck was what true Virtual Reality should be, full body tactile immersion both narrative immersion, which occurs “when the viewer becomes emotionally invested in the story” and the feeling of “really being there”, called spatial immersion.</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Differences between VR, AR and MR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Virtual Reality Technology: Current State and Future Challenges <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _</p><h2 id="The-equipment-used-for-VR-is-very-expensive"><a href="#The-equipment-used-for-VR-is-very-expensive" class="headerlink" title="The equipment used for VR is very expensive"></a>The equipment used for VR is very expensive</h2><p> Of course with any early stage technology, there are a host of issues to overcome among the first is cost for consumers to participate. Many systems run between $100 and $600 and we have not yet discussed the cost of purchasing experiences or games.</p><h2 id="Low-resoultion-content-large-file-size"><a href="#Low-resoultion-content-large-file-size" class="headerlink" title="Low resoultion content, large file size"></a>Low resoultion content, large file size</h2><p> The new goggles or headsets that are coming out offer best available high resolution displays. But gaming experience is coming on at low resolution, leaving you with a low resolution experience. Below is a greatly condensed technical discussion explaining why VR is still so profoundly mediocre.</p><ul><li><strong>File size</strong></li></ul><p> Current VR platforms require a some kind of download to begin. Often the file sizes are over 1 GB and requisitely, slow.</p><ul><li><strong>Video quality</strong></li></ul><p> The next issue is simply video quality. Most VR is in stereo format and the hardware is just not able to fully support it. The video comes through grainy and muffled like it was shot that way and of course it was not. Improved resolution is the fix. There is another obvious thought here. Why claim to have a market worthy product when one of the fundamental technologies, viewing, is still unstable?</p><ul><li><strong>Resolution</strong></li></ul><p> What is the issue with fixing resolution. A couple of questions must be addressed to solve the problems. What is the display resolution? This is the screen resolution. The second question is, “Does all of the images that can come through, actually come through or is it cut off in some way?” This is field-of-view resolution. These questions have technical answers and industry engineers are working to provide a seamless solution, but we are brought back to the conclusion that VR technology while close to delivering true Phase I, which is reasonably easy to use technology is not quite there. Industry insiders use language like it is still in its experimental stage, of course that will not stop the industry from selling these units to early adopters.</p><ul><li><strong>Social Consequences</strong></li></ul><p> There is an addictive quality of Virtual Reality environments that should not be ignored. Those who are regular users of these spaces, even in its developmental state find that it can be hard to stay away. Users find themselves in some cases, preferring the virtual world to the real one. If these anecdotal experiences are being reported by a very small sample size what will be the impact on entire cultures that embrace this technology? Considerations of Virtual Reality must extend into the world of human activity and definitions of normal behavior. And as a reminder most of us who love science fiction have a sense of what true Virtual Reality really is. It should be clear that we are a very long way from enjoying the holodeck.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink"

Suppose, you wish to shoot a blooming bud or the even smaller pollens, the bugs or the worms, capturing the macro elements of nature needs a certain skill.</p><p>Shooting macro video is an art form because it requires balancing the technicalities of the camera along with the aesthetic and creative beauty of nature.</p><p>Any person having a photography background can learn the nuances of the macro video quickly as macro photohgraphy is usually a part of their subject and macro video is an extension of the same.</p><h2 id="6-Tips-For-Making-Macro-Video"><a href="#6-Tips-For-Making-Macro-Video" class="headerlink" title="6 Tips For Making Macro Video"></a>6 Tips For Making Macro Video</h2><p>The difference between the macro video and the macro photo mainly depends on the light acquisition.</p><p>You need a good amount of light in the macro photography whereas, in <a class="link"   href="http://www.uwphotographyguide.com/3-tips-underwater-macro-video" >macro video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it is not possible to have a continuous light focus on the small subject.</p><p>You may hand-hold the camera to click a macro photograph but, it is not possible in case of macro video. The 6 tips below could give you some thoughts.</p><h4 id="1-The-Importance-Of-Lighting"><a href="#1-The-Importance-Of-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="1. The Importance Of Lighting"></a>1. The Importance Of Lighting</h4><p>While shooting the depth of a subject in the macro video, proper lighting is highly essential. The object you are capturing must have a good amount of light focus on it.</p><p>But, you must be prepared to use your intelligence as well as creativity with the shooting.</p><p>For example, while shooting rare species snails that cannot be exposed to halogen light due to the heat produced by it, you can creatively use the LED lights which are cooler.</p><p>You must be careful to use the right kind of light according to your shooting subject.</p><p>Like while shooting a shiny object that can reflect the light, you may use diffusing lights by making a paper cone, focussing on the subject, and evenly directing the lights through the paper to lessen the glare while macro video shooting.</p><p>Around the lens, you may use a ring of LED lights in order to avert the incoming light while shooting a subject very closely.</p><h4 id="2-Tripod"><a href="#2-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="2. Tripod"></a>2. Tripod</h4><p>How can a tripod be helpful in capturing a macro video?</p><p>A macro video is shot from a close distance. If your camera is in motion, it can spoil your video. A tripod helps in a stable and steady macro video shoot, although being completely dependent on the tripod is not a great idea.</p><p>Try to get great visual perspectives or angles by bracing the camera on the tree or ground on any other stable object.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oconnor-ultimate-1030d-fluid-head-30l-cf-tripod.jpg"                      alt="Tripod"                ></p><h4 id="3-Background"><a href="#3-Background" class="headerlink" title="3. Background"></a>3. Background</h4><p>The background of your macro video always remains blurred as you shoot it closely. But, the background color is visible so, choosing it correctly is vital. The color of the background must compliment your composition’s color and must be chosen creatively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/separate-the-foreground-from-background.jpg"                      alt="background"                ></p><h4 id="4-DSLR-Cameras"><a href="#4-DSLR-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="4. DSLR Cameras"></a>4. DSLR Cameras</h4><p>For capturing the macro video, you can consider digital SLR camera. The macro lens of the digital SLR camera is a great option for capturing.</p><p>If you are a Canon user, you may opt for the 180 mm macro, 100 mm macro or the 65 mm MP-E lens to shoot the macro video.</p><p>You may also add an extension tube which basically splits the focal distance in two equal halves and make the image size bigger but it decreases the depth of the field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dslr-camera-full-rig.jpg"                      alt="dslr camera"                ></p><h4 id="5-Depth-of-Field"><a href="#5-Depth-of-Field" class="headerlink" title="5. Depth of Field"></a>5. Depth of Field</h4><p>The lens has certain limitation to capture and focus the subject closely. The camera’s aperture can be adjusted to control the depth of your field.</p><p>What is an aperture? It is the opening of the lens. The smaller the opening of the lens is, the better is the depth of field for your macro video.</p><p>But, you must remember that when the opening of the lens is small, the light required is more.

Everybody expects to capture some magnificent water videos during adventurous expeditions. However, foggy layers due to the water condensation on the surface of your camera lenses can pose problems and result in poor and hazy picture output. Assorting proper measures, you can easily eliminate these limitations and shoot high-resolution water videos. Here are some effective ways to deal with GoPro fog problems and shoot clear water videos.</p><h2 id="Why-Does-Fog-Accumulate-on-Your-GoPro-Camera"><a href="#Why-Does-Fog-Accumulate-on-Your-GoPro-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Why Does Fog Accumulate on Your GoPro Camera"></a>Why Does Fog Accumulate on Your GoPro Camera</h2><p> The GoPro Hero series cameras are fully protected by the waterproof casing. The case does not allow water from outside to penetrate inside and vice versa. This often causes the problem of fogging. If there are traces of moisture&#x2F;humidity inside the case for some reason and the external temperature is cold, the condition leads to the condensation of the traces of humidity inside the device. This condensed moisture traces accumulate on the lenses forming foggy layer.</p><p> The fogging up on the camera lenses due to moisture presence inside the device is a common occurrence during winter water sports due to greater difference in external and internal temperatures.</p><h2 id="Best-Ways-to-Avoid-or-Eliminate-Fog-on-GoPro-Camera-Lenses"><a href="#Best-Ways-to-Avoid-or-Eliminate-Fog-on-GoPro-Camera-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Best Ways to Avoid or Eliminate Fog on GoPro Camera Lenses"></a>Best Ways to Avoid or Eliminate Fog on GoPro Camera Lenses</h2><p> The easiest solution to prevent GoPro fog deposition issues is to take out the moisture trapped inside the camera device. If there is no moisture residue inside, there will not be any chances of condensation problems. Following are some convenient options to eliminate fog from GoPro camera.</p><h4 id="Use-Anti-fog-Inserts"><a href="#Use-Anti-fog-Inserts" class="headerlink" title="Use Anti-fog Inserts"></a>Use Anti-fog Inserts</h4><p> The anti-fog inserts are reusable low cost drying agents with superb capacity to absorb water molecules. The commercial grade anti-fog inserts contain silica gel of very high quality with cellulose fiber. The gel packed in small sacks is often provided inside electronic goods to keep the moisture away. When you insert the silica bags inside the camera, it will readily soak the moisture. You can take out the bag and dry it naturally or in the microwave oven for future use.</p><p><strong>Best recommendations:</strong></p><p> 1. GoPro Anti Fog Inserts - $15.39</p><p> A single pack of GoPro Anti Fog Insert contains 12 sacks of silica gel. Each sack is compatible for up to 4 uses. These sacks require regular drying after every use. You can apply 300-degree temperature heating in the oven for five minutes to complete the drying process. After using and drying, store the inserts in airtight container.</p><p> 2. CamKix Anti-fog Inserts - $5.69</p><p> These inserts are affordable compared to the GoPro inserts in terms of price and product quantity. A single pack contains 20 sacks of silica gel inserts. The size of the sacks and product quality is compatible for using in all GoPro camera models. These reusable sacks can be dried in the oven at 300 degree Fahrenheit.</p><p> 3. Wose Anti-fog inserts - $5.59</p><p> Comparing the price of all the three anti fog inserts, you will find Wose as the cheapest product in the market. You will get 24 pieces of silica gel sacks in a pack of Wose inserts. The sacks contain 3M adhesive material of extra strong industrial grade. These sacks are also compatible for multiple usages after drying in the oven as mentioned above.</p><h4 id="DIY-GoPro-Anti-fog-insert"><a href="#DIY-GoPro-Anti-fog-insert" class="headerlink" title="DIY GoPro Anti-fog insert"></a>DIY GoPro Anti-fog insert</h4><p> The major drawback of using the GoPro anti-fog inserts is the cost factor. On average, the cost of a pack of 12 inserts is $15. The pack is sufficient for using 4 times. With a simple DIY method, you can save the dollars. Follow these simple steps to soak all the moisture in your camera.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take a thick paper towel and cut strips of 0.75”x3” dimension.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Fold the strips in rectangular shape in a way that you can place them firmly inside the camera case.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The size of your GoPro camera will depend on the version you possess. Place the folded paper towel pieces inside the case on the camera everywhere so that it absorbs moisture from all parts. You may need 3 to 6 paper pieces to soak the moisture completely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-windows-10-indispensable-hacks-and-fixes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unlocking Windows 10  Indispensable Hacks & Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-achieving-stunning-iphone-hdr-results/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Achieving Stunning iPhone HDR Results</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pixel-to-passion-unlocking-new-forms-of-entertainment-with-vr/"><u>2024 Approved  Pixel to Passion  Unlocking New Forms of Entertainment with VR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-inside-the-revolutionary-world-of-jaunt-vr/"><u>2024 Approved  Inside the Revolutionary World of Jaunt VR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/the-5-best-tools-to-convert-videos-directly-to-twitter/"><u>The 5 Best Tools to Convert Videos Directly to Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-compose-your-story-best-mobile-annotation-tools/"><u>In 2024, Compose Your Story  Best Mobile Annotation Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-art-of-podcast-blurbs-techniques-and-illustrations/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Art of Podcast Blurbs  Techniques and Illustrations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/integrate-efficiently-macos-sierra-for-desktop-enhancement/"><u>Integrate Efficiently  MacOS Sierra for Desktop Enhancement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-your-interface-mastery-with-these-less-known-windows-11-strategies/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Your Interface Mastery with These Less-Known Windows 11 Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-elevating-discussions-speaking-to-subscribers-effectively/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Discussions  Speaking to Subscribers Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-mobile-captions-ios-and-androids-leading-helpers/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Mobile Captions  IOS & Android's Leading Helpers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-art-of-filter-and-music-integration-in-windows-10-photos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering the Art of Filter & Music Integration in Windows 10 Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-your-ultimate-guide-to-samsungs-best-gear-vr-games-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Your Ultimate Guide to Samsung's Best Gear VR Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-asmrs-wellness-boost-for-you/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unlocking ASMR's Wellness Boost for You</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-skydrives-frugal-option-minimal-price-maximum-space-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Skydrive's Frugal Option  Minimal Price, Maximum Space for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-comprehensive-overview-dji-inspire-2/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Comprehensive Overview -

These days, most computers have built-in webcams, so one of the easiest ways to start recording video is to use a webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-webcam-for-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast camera"                ></p><p>Webcams are inexpensive, easy to set up, and usually already come pre-loaded with software that will allow you to record video and audio for your podcast.</p><h2 id="What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting"><a href="#What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting" class="headerlink" title="What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?"></a>What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?</h2><p>Adding video to your podcasts can help them stand out. However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view"><a href="#1-Field-of-view" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><h3 id="2-Picture-quality"><a href="#2-Picture-quality" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software"><a href="#3-Companion-software" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful. The final product will look much better. You can add your music to your videos, text your podcasts and other media, or edit and remix your audio and video recordings using the editing features. And you know what the most exciting part about webcam companion software is? That the downloading is free of cost.</p><h2 id="The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022"><a href="#The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022"></a>The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022</h2><p>Each year, the technology people use to listen to podcasts continues to improve.

These days, most computers have built-in webcams, so one of the easiest ways to start recording video is to use a webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-webcam-for-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast camera"                ></p><p>Webcams are inexpensive, easy to set up, and usually already come pre-loaded with software that will allow you to record video and audio for your podcast.</p><h2 id="What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting-1"><a href="#What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting-1" class="headerlink" title="What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?"></a>What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?</h2><p>Adding video to your podcasts can help them stand out. However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view-1"><a href="#1-Field-of-view-1" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><h3 id="2-Picture-quality-1"><a href="#2-Picture-quality-1" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software-1"><a href="#3-Companion-software-1" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful. The final product will look much better. You can add your music to your videos, text your podcasts and other media, or edit and remix your audio and video recordings using the editing features. And you know what the most exciting part about webcam companion software is? That the downloading is free of cost.</p><h2 id="The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022-1"><a href="#The-10-best-webcams-for-podcasting-in-2022-1" class="headerlink" title="The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022"></a>The 10 best webcams for podcasting in 2022</h2><p>Each year, the technology people use to listen to podcasts continues to improve.

Let’s take a look at some of the best photo watermarking software products you can use in 2021.</p><h4 id="1-iWatermark-Pro"><a href="#1-iWatermark-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. iWatermark Pro"></a>1. iWatermark Pro</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $30</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, iOS, Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iwatermark-pro-photo-watermark-software.jpg"                      alt="Photo watermark software Iwatermark Pro"                ></p><p>This cross-platform watermarking app can be used with image editors like Lightroom, ACDSee or Photoshop or as a standalone app. Furthermore, iWatermark Pro is compatible with a broad range of digital cameras, so you don’t have to worry about file formats, as the app lets you import or export photos in JPEG, PNG, TIFF or RAW file formats. The software’s list of watermarking features includes options like Signature, Arc Text, StegoMark or Metadata that enable you to add visible and invisible watermarks to your photos and videos. iWatermark also offers batch processing feature so that you can simultaneously add watermarks with the exact same settings to multiple images.</p><h4 id="2-uMark"><a href="#2-uMark" class="headerlink" title="2. uMark"></a>2. uMark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, $29 for a full version of the software</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS</p><p>There are different options of the software available, so you can opt for uMark Photo Watermarker if you’re only working with photos or you can use uMark Video Watermarker in case you often upload videos to the Internet. The app lets you use both text and images as watermarks on your photos, and it also offers powerful batch processing options that automate the process of watermarking large amounts of images. In addition to conventional watermarking options, uMark also lets you watermark your photos with QR codes or different shapes. You can easily customize all the watermarks you create with this software or save them if you want to use them on future projects.</p><h4 id="3-Arclab-Watermark-Studio"><a href="#3-Arclab-Watermark-Studio" class="headerlink" title="3. Arclab Watermark Studio"></a>3. Arclab Watermark Studio</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, pricing plans start from $29 for a single computer license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>Even though the number of options Arclab’s Watermark Studio provides is somewhat underwhelming, the software still offers all the tools you need to customize your watermark. You can choose the font, the size of the text or adjust the opacity of each watermark you create with Arclab Watermark Studio and even use logos as watermarks. The option to add multiple watermarks to a single image is also available as well as the batch processing feature that lets you apply the same watermark to an unlimited number of pictures. The Arclab Watermark Studio is equipped with image resizing tools which makes it a perfect choice for photographers who often post their work on social media.</p><h4 id="4-TSR-Watermark-Image"><a href="#4-TSR-Watermark-Image" class="headerlink" title="4. TSR Watermark Image"></a>4. TSR Watermark Image</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $29.95</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Professional photographers who have previous experience with photo editing software, won’t need too much time to get used to TSR Watermark Image. Besides the basic text and image watermarking options, the software also offers the 3D watermark feature. The images that were taken with Canon, Sony, Nikon, and numerous other cameras can also be watermarked through metadata. The TSR Watermark Image app provides a rich selection of special effects, borders, and crosses that let you create stylish watermarks. The free version of this photo watermarking software offers only a limited amount of options and if you want to gain access to more than 200 fonts or advanced uploading features you must purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p><h4 id="5-Mass-Watermark"><a href="#5-Mass-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="5. Mass Watermark"></a>5. Mass Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $30 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>As its name suggests, Mass Watermark is designed to make the process of watermarking large quantities of photos quick and simple. In addition to powerful batch processing features this watermarking software for Mac and PC computers is equipped with Image Optimization tools that let you improve the overall quality of your photos before you apply a watermark to them. The app’s Watermark Designer lets you customize each watermark you create, while the Crop, Rotate and Resize features enable you to optimize your pictures for online use. What’s more, you can upload your photos to Flickr or your Picasa Web Album directly from Mass Watermark.</p><h4 id="6-Watermark-Software"><a href="#6-Watermark-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Watermark Software"></a>6. Watermark Software</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $24.90 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>The fact that you can watermark up to 300 photos in just one minute with this photo watermarking software speaks volumes about its capabilities. In fact, you can watermark all your photos with Watermark Software in just three easy steps, since you just have to import the images to which you want to add a watermark, insert text or picture you’d like to use as a watermark and wait for the app to process them. The Watermark Tiling feature makes unauthorized usage of your work even more difficult, while the EXIF editor enables you to add watermarks to a photo’s metadata. The free version of the app offers only a limited number of features, and you must purchase the lifetime license if want to use all the watermarking tools this app has to offer.</p><h4 id="7-Alamoon-Watermark"><a href="#7-Alamoon-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="7. Alamoon Watermark"></a>7. Alamoon Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>Despite being slightly outdated, Alamoon Watermark software is still a reliable option for all photographers who are looking for a simple way to add watermarks to their photos. This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes. However, it lacks advanced watermarking and photo editing tools, so enhancing the colors in a photo or creating watermark templates is not possible with Alamoon Watermark app. The professional version of this watermarking software is largely overpriced and there are more powerful and more affordable options available.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Watermark"><a href="#8-Star-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Watermark"></a>8. Star Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, pricing plans start at $17 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>Customizing each watermark you create with this cross-platform app is a straightforward process that won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can easily alter the size of the text, change its color, add shadows or position the text anywhere in the photo. Star Watermark enables its users to use images as watermarks or even create multilayered watermarks. The batch processing features, however, remain one of the most common reasons why professional photographers opt to use the Star Watermark software. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t offer any of the advanced watermarking features, and it doesn’t allow you to use your digital signature as a watermark.</p><h4 id="9-Visual-Watermark"><a href="#9-Visual-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="9. Visual Watermark"></a>9. Visual Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $19.95 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Android</p><p>The Visual Watermark software makes watermarking hundreds of photos in a short period of time look easy. Besides watermarking photos, you can also use the Visual Watermark application to add watermarks to videos. There are 260 fonts available, but you can also import your own custom-made fonts and use them to create watermarks. The software adjusts the size and the position of the watermark to each photo automatically, but you can also fine-tune each of these settings manually. Most importantly, the Visual Watermark software protects your images from artificial intelligence algorithms that remove watermarks from photos automatically by making minor changes to the template you’re applying to the photos you’re processing.</p><h4 id="10-Water-Marquee"><a href="#10-Water-Marquee" class="headerlink" title="10. Water Marquee"></a>10. Water Marquee</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images. The process of adding a watermark to a photo with Water Marquee is remarkably simple, as you just have to upload a photo to the platform and click on the Add Text, Add Logo or Use Template option. You can then proceed to insert the text, select its size, color or font and decide if you want to use a solid or transparent background. When done, simply click on the Save icon and choose the destination folder on your hard drive in which the watermarked photo is going to be stored.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos?

That’s about the film’s scripting, which is the way of writing a movie script or the writing used in Films scripts. Today’s article will discuss the most commonly used script writing types, <strong>Dialogue Script</strong> and <strong>Narrative Script</strong>. And the best five tips to follow for a fantastic script with <strong>Dialogue and Narrative Script examples</strong>. Let’s look into it!</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Pay attention to the conversations in your real life</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Let each character have its voice and characteristics. Not a second you</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">No meaningless or only question-and-answer type dialogue</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Control the rhythm of the conversations</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Don’t use full sentences that contain too much underlying meaning</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best dialogue and narrative examples from movies</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Make your dialogue script come true using Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dialogue-and-Narrative-Script"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dialogue-and-Narrative-Script" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Dialogue and Narrative Script?"></a>Part 1. What is Dialogue and Narrative Script?</h2><h3 id="Definition"><a href="#Definition" class="headerlink" title="Definition"></a><strong>Definition</strong></h3><p>The Narrative Script is a story. It consists of the whole narration of the story by the writer. On the other hand, Dialogue Script is the talk between the characters. So you can say that the entire story of the script is Narrative writing and the discussions between characters are Dialogues.</p><h3 id="Key-Features"><a href="#Key-Features" class="headerlink" title="Key Features"></a><strong>Key Features</strong></h3><p>Both these types of script writing are essential to writing a successful storyline. At the same time, we use Dialogues in nearly every script. The Narrative Script is a vital type, especially if you want to make your storyline even more precise and exciting.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Five-Tips-for-Writing-Dialogue-and-Narrative-Scripts"><a href="#Part-2-Five-Tips-for-Writing-Dialogue-and-Narrative-Scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Five Tips for Writing Dialogue and Narrative Scripts"></a>Part 2. Five Tips for Writing Dialogue and Narrative Scripts</h2><p>Now here are some essential tips for writing fantastic Dialogue and Narrative Scripts.</p><h3 id="1-Pay-attention-to-the-conversations-in-your-real-life"><a href="#1-Pay-attention-to-the-conversations-in-your-real-life" class="headerlink" title="1. Pay attention to the conversations in your real life"></a>1. Pay attention to the conversations in your real life</h3><p>One of the best tips for good scripting is to be natural; for it, you can look and take inspiration from your real life. Just note the behavior of people and the progress of the world around you. Record these experiences, which will help you provide a natural touch in your script.</p><h3 id="2-Let-each-character-have-its-voice-and-characteristics-Not-a-second-you"><a href="#2-Let-each-character-have-its-voice-and-characteristics-Not-a-second-you" class="headerlink" title="2. Let each character have its voice and characteristics. Not a second you"></a>2. Let each character have its voice and characteristics. Not a second you</h3><p>Sometimes when we write, we lose our concentration and write all the characters’ dialogue in the same way. But it’s not good because a good script always has consistency from start to end. You must write each character’s dialogues in their own way and expression.</p><h3 id="3-No-meaningless-or-only-question-and-answer-type-dialogue"><a href="#3-No-meaningless-or-only-question-and-answer-type-dialogue" class="headerlink" title="3. No meaningless or only question-and-answer type dialogue"></a>3. No meaningless or only question-and-answer type dialogue</h3><p>If your dialogue script is only comprised of questions and answers, keep in mind that it won’t be very interesting. Moreover, we sometimes compose talks that are meaningless, which is another serious issue. Focus on writing conversation in a balanced manner with meaningful usage to overcome these problems.</p><h3 id="4-Control-the-rhythm-of-the-conversations"><a href="#4-Control-the-rhythm-of-the-conversations" class="headerlink" title="4. Control the rhythm of the conversations"></a>4. Control the rhythm of the conversations</h3><p>Controlling the conversation is one of the essential tips. Primarily, our actual conversation doesn’t complete. It means that we mix it with other dialogues without proper punctuation. Be careful about punctuation while writing conversations.</p><h3 id="5-Don’t-use-full-sentences-that-contain-too-much-underlying-meaning"><a href="#5-Don’t-use-full-sentences-that-contain-too-much-underlying-meaning" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t use full sentences that contain too much underlying meaning"></a>5. Don’t use full sentences that contain too much underlying meaning</h3><p>Whenever you read something, you’ll lose interest in it if the writer uses full and long sentences a lot. Because, in reality, it seems robotic. On the other hand, some writers don’t use full sentences and keep them short. Their story seems more interesting because it’s a long-established fact that using full sentences, especially in script writing, distracts the audience, and they become bored.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-dialogue-and-narrative-examples-from-movies"><a href="#Part-3-Best-dialogue-and-narrative-examples-from-movies" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Best dialogue and narrative examples from movies"></a>Part 3. Best dialogue and narrative examples from movies</h2><p>Check out the examples below of how great dialogue has impacted movies as an essential component of the script.</p><h3 id="1-The-Man-from-Earth"><a href="#1-The-Man-from-Earth" class="headerlink" title="1. The Man from Earth"></a><strong>1. The Man from Earth</strong></h3><p>Professor John Oldman’s farewell party turns into a mysterious and interesting debate among colleagues after he asked strange question. It’s an audio movie, but probably more like a stage play, that is, a single scene with multiple characters. Everyone gave their opinion on a single issue.</p><p>The reason for introducing this movie as the first example is that the screenwriter provided a perfect example. He showed you how to control a debate or discussion in a movie.</p><h3 id="2-Before-Sunrise"><a href="#2-Before-Sunrise" class="headerlink" title="2. Before Sunrise"></a><strong>2. Before Sunrise</strong></h3><p>This movie teaches you how to explore the relationship between two characters in a single scene and through dialogue by focusing on their interaction.</p><p>Although sounding cinematically natural, the conversation in the movie is absolutely real. They interrupt each other. Their thoughts follow different paths through different tangents.</p><h3 id="3-Pulp-Fiction"><a href="#3-Pulp-Fiction" class="headerlink" title="3. Pulp Fiction"></a><strong>3. Pulp Fiction</strong></h3><p>Films by Quentin Tarantino are notable for their dialogue. This is because he will not really waste any words when writing.

Thanks for Reading.</p><p>Part 1. What is Dialogue and Narrative Script?</p><h3 id="Definition-1"><a href="#Definition-1" class="headerlink" title="Definition"></a><strong>Definition</strong></h3><p>The Narrative Script is a story. It consists of the whole narration of the story by the writer. On the other hand, Dialogue Script is the talk between the characters. So you can say that the entire story of the script is Narrative writing and the discussions between characters are Dialogues.</p><h3 id="Key-Features-1"><a href="#Key-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Features"></a><strong>Key Features</strong></h3><p>Both these types of script writing are essential to writing a successful storyline. At the same time, we use Dialogues in nearly every script. The Narrative Script is a vital type, especially if you want to make your storyline even more precise and exciting.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Five-Tips-for-Writing-Dialogue-and-Narrative-Scripts-1"><a href="#Part-2-Five-Tips-for-Writing-Dialogue-and-Narrative-Scripts-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Five Tips for Writing Dialogue and Narrative Scripts"></a>Part 2. Five Tips for Writing Dialogue and Narrative Scripts</h2><p>Now here are some essential tips for writing fantastic Dialogue and Narrative Scripts.</p><h3 id="1-Pay-attention-to-the-conversations-in-your-real-life-1"><a href="#1-Pay-attention-to-the-conversations-in-your-real-life-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Pay attention to the conversations in your real life"></a>1. Pay attention to the conversations in your real life</h3><p>One of the best tips for good scripting is to be natural; for it, you can look and take inspiration from your real life. Just note the behavior of people and the progress of the world around you. Record these experiences, which will help you provide a natural touch in your script.</p><h3 id="2-Let-each-character-have-its-voice-and-characteristics-Not-a-second-you-1"><a href="#2-Let-each-character-have-its-voice-and-characteristics-Not-a-second-you-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Let each character have its voice and characteristics. Not a second you"></a>2. Let each character have its voice and characteristics. Not a second you</h3><p>Sometimes when we write, we lose our concentration and write all the characters’ dialogue in the same way. But it’s not good because a good script always has consistency from start to end. You must write each character’s dialogues in their own way and expression.</p><h3 id="3-No-meaningless-or-only-question-and-answer-type-dialogue-1"><a href="#3-No-meaningless-or-only-question-and-answer-type-dialogue-1" class="headerlink" title="3. No meaningless or only question-and-answer type dialogue"></a>3. No meaningless or only question-and-answer type dialogue</h3><p>If your dialogue script is only comprised of questions and answers, keep in mind that it won’t be very interesting. Moreover, we sometimes compose talks that are meaningless, which is another serious issue. Focus on writing conversation in a balanced manner with meaningful usage to overcome these problems.</p><h3 id="4-Control-the-rhythm-of-the-conversations-1"><a href="#4-Control-the-rhythm-of-the-conversations-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Control the rhythm of the conversations"></a>4. Control the rhythm of the conversations</h3><p>Controlling the conversation is one of the essential tips. Primarily, our actual conversation doesn’t complete. It means that we mix it with other dialogues without proper punctuation. Be careful about punctuation while writing conversations.</p><h3 id="5-Don’t-use-full-sentences-that-contain-too-much-underlying-meaning-1"><a href="#5-Don’t-use-full-sentences-that-contain-too-much-underlying-meaning-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t use full sentences that contain too much underlying meaning"></a>5. Don’t use full sentences that contain too much underlying meaning</h3><p>Whenever you read something, you’ll lose interest in it if the writer uses full and long sentences a lot. Because, in reality, it seems robotic. On the other hand, some writers don’t use full sentences and keep them short. Their story seems more interesting because it’s a long-established fact that using full sentences, especially in script writing, distracts the audience, and they become bored.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-dialogue-and-narrative-examples-from-movies-1"><a href="#Part-3-Best-dialogue-and-narrative-examples-from-movies-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Best dialogue and narrative examples from movies"></a>Part 3.

The Man from Earth"></a><strong>1. The Man from Earth</strong></h3><p>Professor John Oldman’s farewell party turns into a mysterious and interesting debate among colleagues after he asked strange question. It’s an audio movie, but probably more like a stage play, that is, a single scene with multiple characters. Everyone gave their opinion on a single issue.</p><p>The reason for introducing this movie as the first example is that the screenwriter provided a perfect example. He showed you how to control a debate or discussion in a movie.</p><h3 id="2-Before-Sunrise-1"><a href="#2-Before-Sunrise-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Before Sunrise"></a><strong>2. Before Sunrise</strong></h3><p>This movie teaches you how to explore the relationship between two characters in a single scene and through dialogue by focusing on their interaction.</p><p>Although sounding cinematically natural, the conversation in the movie is absolutely real. They interrupt each other. Their thoughts follow different paths through different tangents.</p><h3 id="3-Pulp-Fiction-1"><a href="#3-Pulp-Fiction-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Popular Text Effects"></a>Part 1. Popular Text Effects</h2><p>There are certain text effects that you generally come across whether you are watching movies, web series, and videos on social media or video streaming platforms. We have compiled a list of the most popular text effects that are extremely relevant in the current times in videography.</p><h3 id="1-Underwater-Text-Effect"><a href="#1-Underwater-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Underwater Text Effect"></a>1. Underwater Text Effect</h3><p>Opening a video with the view of a beach and blue water is definitely stunning. But when you add an underwater text effect to display any title, it instantly grabs the attention of the viewers. In the underwater text effect, your text seems to be fixated or floating under the water. The text generally has a darker shade of blue over the light bluish water.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/under-water-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="under water text effect"                ></p><p>The text also has some distortion effect due to the waves in the water body so that it looks more realistic. There are different variations of that underwater text effect such as the text emerging out of water when there is a side view of the water body is taken. Another example of the variation is that text is floating over the water and having a watery gel or bubbly texture.</p><h3 id="2-Flame-Text-Effect"><a href="#2-Flame-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Flame Text Effect"></a>2. Flame Text Effect</h3><p>Flame text effect is extremely common in the opening and closing credits of a video especially when it is an action video. Generally, a dark background is set against the fiery text so that the flame effect is more prominent and eye-catching. In fact, some video creators prefer a fiery background out of which the text with flame text effect emerges and make the required impact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flame-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="flame text effect"                ></p><p>There are different variations of the flame text effect available which make the effect relevant even today. Instead of the flame text effect spread outside of the text, the effect is contained within the text when the text is large enough to accommodate flames prominently within it. Sometimes, the text is distorted as if the fire is burning the text.</p><h3 id="3-Glitch-Text-Effect"><a href="#3-Glitch-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. Glitch Text Effect"></a>3. Glitch Text Effect</h3><p>Glitch text effect is an extremely popular effect in modern times where retro video effects are reaching a new high. The glitch text effect is designed to get the attention of the viewers instantly. In the glitch text effect, the text is divided into different sections and they are distorted or dispersed slightly as if your screen has a display issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/glitch-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="glitch text effect"                ></p><p>Glitch text effect is more prominent when it is applied to a large text having a light color against a dark background. The use of shadow and blur effect to get the desired glitch effect is common. More often than not, some short straight lines like strokes are placed around the text to enhance the glitch effect.

This text effect is widely used when there is a need to highlight certain words in a sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/blurry-fade-on-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="blurry fade on text effect"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868499/19272" target="_top" id="1868499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868499/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In fact, the text effect is used to highlight a few characters in a word while the others remain blurred. You can also use the effect when you are making transitions between different texts and titles. It is more like an add-on to the usual fade on effect as it adds a blurring effect. It is important to get the attention of the viewers to specific texts.</p><h3 id="7-Type-on-Text-Effect-1"><a href="#7-Type-on-Text-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Type on Text Effect"></a>7. Type on Text Effect</h3><p>The type on text effect is also referred to as the typewriter effect. In this effect, the characters in the text appear one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time with a typewriter. A blinking cursor is placed at the end for the characters for a more realistic look. The text effect is useful for both one-liners as well as paragraphs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/type-on-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="type on text effect"                ></p><p>It breaks the monotony of showing an entire paragraph at once. Sometimes, a modified version of the type on text effect is used whereby some characters are shown and they are deleted backward and re-typed. This helps in getting the immediate attention of the viewers and they focus on the re-typed characters or words.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Animate-Along-a-Path-1"><a href="#8-Animate-Along-a-Path-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Animate Along a Path"></a>8. Animate Along a Path</h3><p>If you are looking for a customized animation for the texts in your video, you should opt for animate along a path effect. The text will move in the pre-defined path while moving along the path, there can be additional animation for the words and characters. The text is widely used for showing one-liner that comes out of nowhere and moves out of the frame following its path.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animate-along-a-path-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="animate along a path text effect"                ></p><p>You can use the effect to show certain lines that are common throughout the video. Besides, you can use it while making transition from one scene to another. Some video creators use them for opening and editing credits so that it can keep the audiences hooked instead of the usual opening and ending credits.</p><h3 id="9-Slide-Text-Effect-1"><a href="#9-Slide-Text-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Slide Text Effect"></a>9. Slide Text Effect</h3><p>If you have watched any informational video, you must have seen small notes sliding in from a bar at the bottom left corner. That is what the slide text effect is all about. The text slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. The sliding in effect can be from any direction as per your preference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/slide-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="slide text effect"                ></p><p>Generally, the slide effect for text is accompanied by a highlighted background so that the text is legible. It is suitable for showing important notes in a few sentences such as showing some facts about a place. The effect is widely used in videos related to news or videos where there are more photos and texts and less voice narration.</p><h3 id="10-Stripe-Text-Effect-1"><a href="#10-Stripe-Text-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Stripe Text Effect"></a>10. Stripe Text Effect</h3><p>Just like the slide text effect, the stripe text effect is equally common in today’s informational videos that you get to see on social media and video streaming platforms. The text appears on the screen out of nowhere and the text gets surrounded by stripes on both sides.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/stripe-text-video-effect.jpg"                      alt="stripe text video effect"                ></p><p>This effect is suitable to introduce titles and topics in a video. Generally, in the stripe text effect, the text style is kept as simple as possible. But you can always tweak it and add stripes within the text to make it more eye-catching.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Text-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Text-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross"></a>Part 2. Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals.

Capacity Matters: Full Frame or APS-C"></a>2. Capacity Matters: Full Frame or APS-C</h4><p> When we talk about capacity of camera lens then two terms comes into consideration: Whether to go for an APS-C lens or spend on Full Frame design. This selection becomes more confusing for beginners. Both of these fits perfectly to all 4K camera models but the biggest benefit of buying APS-C lens is that it use to be light in weight with its compact size whereas the full frame lenses are large enough; they are going to add little weight to your bag. Not to forget that the full frame lenses are costly option.</p><h4 id="3-Type-of-Lens-that-suits-your-needs"><a href="#3-Type-of-Lens-that-suits-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="3. Type of Lens that suits your needs"></a>3. Type of Lens that suits your needs</h4><p> One important parameter for selection of camera lenses is their focal range; this configuration can make great difference in picture quality. Below are few details about 6 most commonly used lens types:</p><p><strong>Ultra Wide:</strong></p><p> Lenses that have focal length equal to or less than 24mm are known as Ultra wide lenses. They are capable enough to capture larger view from scene but here also you can have two options for selection: fisheye to get curved details and rectilinear to maintain straight lines. Ultra wide lenses fall in the category of professional lenses and they are commonly used to capture interior details, architectures and landscapes. Professionals have tricks to get positive results even from the noise produced by fisheye lenses.</p><p><strong>Wide Angle:</strong></p><p> The focal length range between 24mm to 35mm makes wide angle lenses. The prime as well as zoom lenses, both are designed with wide angle focus and you can also have an option to get variable aperture ranges or choose the fixed one. Wide angle lenses usually create more loses but professionals can maintain artistic quality from this noise too. These lenses can be used to capture buildings, landscapes and allow better focus on large gatherings. Many professionals love to capture portraits with wide angle lenses.</p><p><strong>Standard&#x2F; Normal:</strong></p><p> The standard zoom lenses generally come with a wide focal length range that varies between 35 mm to 70 mm whereas photographers call prime lenses with 50mm focal length as normal ones. It is observed to receive faster maximum aperture setting from normal prime lenses and it assists in low light shooting while maintaining shallow field depth.

You will definitely find difference in image characteristics with standard and normal selection.</p><p><strong>Telephoto:</strong></p><p> When focal length value goes up to 70mm then it comes in the category of Telephoto lenses. However, many professionals believe that a lens with 135mm focal length is a true Telephoto lens. If you want to get specific details from distant subjects then telephoto lenses can help you to maintain narrower field of view. It means you will avail scenes with blurred background where specific subjects will have more focus. The best idea is to use them for wildlife photography and you can also use them to capture portraits.</p><p><strong>Superzoom:</strong></p><p> The superzoom lenses offer focal length variations between wide to telephoto so you can find them more useful for variable focal length needs- they can serve you without the trouble of changing lens again and again to maintain different focal length. So, they are better known as do it all lenses that offer slower yet variable maximum aperture range. You will find them more useful for your tours when you really don’t want to make your luggage heavier with multiple lenses.</p><p><strong>Macro:</strong></p><p> These lenses come in the category of special lenses and they ensure reproduction ratios higher than 1:1. This is the best choice for extreme close up type photography as you will get focal length range somewhere between 40 to 200mm. These lenses offer extreme sharpness in details while maintaining very small depth of field for close-up shots. They are perfect choice for portraits or close up photography needs as they offer impressive focal length range with stunning sharpness.</p><h4 id="4-Zoom-or-Prime-Each-has-Unique-Features"><a href="#4-Zoom-or-Prime-Each-has-Unique-Features" class="headerlink" title="4. Zoom or Prime: Each has Unique Features"></a>4. Zoom or Prime: Each has Unique Features</h4><p> When we talk about zoom lenses, they make things convenient by allowing zoom between wide angles to telephoto level; so you need not to use multiple lenses. This can be suitable choice for landscape photography. On the other side, Prime lenses offer wide aperture ranges while ensuring higher image quality. Those who need a lens for their landscape photography needs will definitely find the zoom lenses more useful with an option to shoot with f&#x2F;8, f&#x2F;16 and f&#x2F;11 with trouble free settings but wide aperture applications demand Prime collection.</p><h4 id="5-Weight-and-Size-They-make-a-big-difference"><a href="#5-Weight-and-Size-They-make-a-big-difference" class="headerlink" title="5. Weight and Size: They make a big difference"></a>5.

One of these is the second most visited website worldwide, which is YouTube. With this, people can communicate with each other and share thoughts by commenting and reacting to someone’s content or posts. In this composition, you will learn how to see YouTube liked comments. But first, let us define what YouTube is.</p><p>People can watch, like, share, comment on, and upload videos using the YouTube service. You can access this video service on PCs, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Are-YouTube’s-Primary-Purposes"><a href="#What-Are-YouTube’s-Primary-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="What Are YouTube’s Primary Purposes?"></a>What Are YouTube’s Primary Purposes?</h2><ul><li>Users can look up and view videos.</li><li>Make your own YouTube channel.</li><li>movie clips to your channel</li><li>Share, like, and comment on other YouTube videos</li><li>Users can follow or subscribe to other YouTube channels.</li><li>To arrange videos and combine them together, make playlists.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Use-YouTube"><a href="#Why-Use-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Why Use YouTube?"></a>Why Use YouTube?</h2><p>YouTube is the second-largest web browser after Google. Every minute, YouTube receives more than 100 hours of video. Whether you’re disseminating information to students or marketing activities, it’s among the most significant ways to reach a large audience. Some of the benefits of YouTube are listed below.</p><p><strong>Your SEO may use some improvement</strong></p><p>One of the most widely used content types is video, frequently shared on social media. Sharing videos on YouTube with quality titles, descriptions, and tags is a terrific strategy to raise your search engine rating because Google and other search engines favor video content.</p><p><strong>Strong Branding</strong></p><p>Your brand messaging can be quickly and effectively communicated through video. Video is a beautiful medium for expressing the feeling and physical characteristics of your marketing because people respond positively to visual cues.</p><p><strong>Don’t Tell, Show</strong></p><p>Concepts that are difficult to express in word form can be effectively demonstrated through video: use screen capture recordings, live demonstrations, or even whiteboard drawings to present to your pupils.</p><p><strong>Reach a Greater Audience with Your Message</strong></p><p>YouTube is the world’s most widely used video site, and its videos are very shareable. Think about how frequently videos appear on your Twitter feed or Facebook Timeline. How often do you get emails with videos? Video may be easily and quickly shared widely.</p><p><strong>You don’t require a huge budget</strong></p><p>While hiring pros to make various sorts of videos has significant advantages, not all videos require a six-figure budget. With only a few pieces of essential video equipment, you may quickly and easily produce influential movies of lectures, demonstrations, and more.</p><p><strong>Mobile-Friendly Video</strong></p><p>Given how many students have smartphones, video is an excellent medium for connecting with them. Most students already use YouTube, which is particularly adapted for mobile devices.</p><p><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong> Best YouTube Video Maker to Create Vlogs with Transitions and Effects.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/box-filmora-x.png"                                     > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-9-square.svg"                                     ></p><h2 id="How-to-See-Liked-Comments-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-See-Liked-Comments-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to See Liked Comments on YouTube?"></a>How to See Liked Comments on YouTube?</h2><p>YouTube is a service that is available for free, and it may be a terrific place for teenagers to find interest. Many young people use YouTube to watch comedy shows, how-to videos, recipes, hacks, and music videos. Teenagers also use the video-sharing platform to subscribe to other YouTubers and famous personalities and to follow their favorite vloggers (video bloggers).</p><p>If you create your own personal YouTube channel and upload your videos, people can like, share, and comment on your videos. You can also comment and like others’ comments on your video. Unfortunately, you can’t see who’s liked or disliked your comments on YouTube, but you can see reactions to your posts.</p><p>If you are still wondering why you can’t see who liked or disliked a Youtube comment, you should know these things:</p><ul><li>Neither you nor anyone else on YouTube can see who liked or disliked your comment.</li><li>YouTube hides users’ likes and dislikes of comments for their protection and security. Still, it’s probably safe to assume that everyone who made a favorable comment on your comment loved it.</li><li>You cannot see who viewed a particular video favorably or unfavorably, but you can see how many individuals did so.</li></ul><p>But, if you want to retrace the videos you commented on and the videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Click on your Google Account icon and find <strong>Your data in YouTube</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/find-your-data-in-youtube.jpg"                      alt="find your data in youtube"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down a little bit and click the <strong>More</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-dashboard-more.jpg"                      alt="your youtube dashboard more"                ></p><p>Step3 Click the <strong>Comments</strong> section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-comments-your-youtube-dashboard.jpg"                      alt="click comments your youtube dashboard"                ></p><p>Now you will see your comment history, including the date when you commented on a certain video and also the exact comment you posted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-comments-date.jpg"                      alt="your youtube comments date"                ></p><p>To see videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, please follow these steps as continuation:</p><p>Step4 In the <strong>Google My Activity</strong> tab, click <strong>Other activity</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/other-activity-youtube-comments.jpg"                      alt="other activity youtube comments"                ></p><p>Step5 Scroll down and find <strong>Comment Likes and Dislikes on YouTube</strong> section.

Keep the conversation (and engagement) going by responding to comments.</p><p>Go to your YouTube Studio page and select Comments from the left-hand menu on YouTube. You can check comments you’ve set up to publish automatically without moderation by going to the Published tab.</p><p>They will be lingering on the Held for Review tab if comments need to be approved. (If you don’t agree or delete them within 60 days, comments will be deleted without your intervention.)</p><p>If you’re dealing with a chatty audience, the filter bar at the top of any tab’s tab enables you to filter by specific text, comments with questions, unanswered comments, and more.</p><p>Currently, there is no way to check the liked comments.</p><p>The “like” and “dislike” buttons are both anonymous. This implies that, even if it does, YouTube does not publicly divulge the user’s identity who likes or dislikes a comment, not even the channel owner.</p><p>The concept of neutrality serves as the foundation for anonymous voting. To prevent voting from being analyzed or abused, everyone who loves or dislikes a comment remains anonymous.</p><p>Therefore, you can do the instructions above to see your liked remarks.</p><p>The 1.7 billion monthly unique users of YouTube can express what they love, detest, or must troll in the comments section. It’s like the internet’s very own Thunderdome, yet despite the potential for hate, YouTube comments may also present a significant chance for participation and community development.</p><p>So! Effectively managing your comments (including moderation, answers, and analysis) is essential if you want to maximize your presence on YouTube as part of your social media strategy.</p><p>Engaging with comments has the additional benefit of elevating you in the YouTube algorithm and demonstrating to your fans and followers that you care about what they have to say. Videos that receive a lot of likes, comments, and moderation typically rank higher in search results.</p><p>After all, this composition wants you to know how to see the YouTube liked comments. If you’re going to work in this field, I hope this information helps and motivates you. This article will end by giving you tips and additional information that can help you, especially when pursuing the YouTube industry.</p><p>Remember that you can only leave comments on videos that are public (or unlisted ones). Additionally, once you leave a comment, it becomes public and is linked to your YouTube account. Make sure your message is in the appropriate tone if you’re representing your company, such as this example from a meditation center playing chillhop music.</p><p>Because understanding how to comment is only one aspect of the issue; very important is knowing how to comment well. A brand’s YouTube remark should provide value beyond simply attempting to sell something.</p><p>Try making a joke, pointing out something amusing, providing helpful information, or expressing sympathy or concern for a fan. Additionally, a simple thumbs-up or heart can go a long way to demonstrate that you are paying attention even if you aren’t feeling very friendly (we all have bad days, it’s OK!).</p><h2 id="Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is"><a href="#Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is" class="headerlink" title="Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?"></a>Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?</h2><p>A highlighted comment on YouTube aims to draw the content creator’s attention with an automated feature.</p><p>When you click over to the comments area after receiving a notification about a new comment or a reply to one of your comments, that particular comment will be highlighted for quick access.</p><p>To put it another way, YouTube flags notable comments for you to ensure that new messages or significant replies aren’t lost in the noise.

Many young people use YouTube to watch comedy shows, how-to videos, recipes, hacks, and music videos. Teenagers also use the video-sharing platform to subscribe to other YouTubers and famous personalities and to follow their favorite vloggers (video bloggers).</p><p>If you create your own personal YouTube channel and upload your videos, people can like, share, and comment on your videos. You can also comment and like others’ comments on your video. Unfortunately, you can’t see who’s liked or disliked your comments on YouTube, but you can see reactions to your posts.</p><p>If you are still wondering why you can’t see who liked or disliked a Youtube comment, you should know these things:</p><ul><li>Neither you nor anyone else on YouTube can see who liked or disliked your comment.</li><li>YouTube hides users’ likes and dislikes of comments for their protection and security. Still, it’s probably safe to assume that everyone who made a favorable comment on your comment loved it.</li><li>You cannot see who viewed a particular video favorably or unfavorably, but you can see how many individuals did so.</li></ul><p>But, if you want to retrace the videos you commented on and the videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Click on your Google Account icon and find <strong>Your data in YouTube</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/find-your-data-in-youtube.jpg"                      alt="find your data in youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528688/16446" target="_top" id="1528688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528688/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 Scroll down a little bit and click the <strong>More</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-dashboard-more.jpg"                      alt="your youtube dashboard more"                ></p><p>Step3 Click the <strong>Comments</strong> section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-comments-your-youtube-dashboard.jpg"                      alt="click comments your youtube dashboard"                ></p><p>Now you will see your comment history, including the date when you commented on a certain video and also the exact comment you posted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/your-youtube-comments-date.jpg"                      alt="your youtube comments date"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005196/22899" target="_top" id="2005196">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005196" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005196/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>To see videos&#x2F;comments you liked or disliked, please follow these steps as continuation:</p><p>Step4 In the <strong>Google My Activity</strong> tab, click <strong>Other activity</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/other-activity-youtube-comments.jpg"                      alt="other activity youtube comments"                ></p><p>Step5 Scroll down and find <strong>Comment Likes and Dislikes on YouTube</strong> section.

That is why there are just written numbers on the like button and on the dislike button there are none.</p><h2 id="How-to-Respond-to-Comments-1"><a href="#How-to-Respond-to-Comments-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Respond to Comments"></a>How to Respond to Comments</h2><p>Don’t ignore someone who has questioned you or written you a heartfelt note. Keep the conversation (and engagement) going by responding to comments.</p><p>Go to your YouTube Studio page and select Comments from the left-hand menu on YouTube. You can check comments you’ve set up to publish automatically without moderation by going to the Published tab.</p><p>They will be lingering on the Held for Review tab if comments need to be approved. (If you don’t agree or delete them within 60 days, comments will be deleted without your intervention.)</p><p>If you’re dealing with a chatty audience, the filter bar at the top of any tab’s tab enables you to filter by specific text, comments with questions, unanswered comments, and more.</p><p>Currently, there is no way to check the liked comments.</p><p>The “like” and “dislike” buttons are both anonymous. This implies that, even if it does, YouTube does not publicly divulge the user’s identity who likes or dislikes a comment, not even the channel owner.</p><p>The concept of neutrality serves as the foundation for anonymous voting. To prevent voting from being analyzed or abused, everyone who loves or dislikes a comment remains anonymous.</p><p>Therefore, you can do the instructions above to see your liked remarks.</p><p>The 1.7 billion monthly unique users of YouTube can express what they love, detest, or must troll in the comments section. It’s like the internet’s very own Thunderdome, yet despite the potential for hate, YouTube comments may also present a significant chance for participation and community development.</p><p>So! Effectively managing your comments (including moderation, answers, and analysis) is essential if you want to maximize your presence on YouTube as part of your social media strategy.</p><p>Engaging with comments has the additional benefit of elevating you in the YouTube algorithm and demonstrating to your fans and followers that you care about what they have to say. Videos that receive a lot of likes, comments, and moderation typically rank higher in search results.</p><p>After all, this composition wants you to know how to see the YouTube liked comments. If you’re going to work in this field, I hope this information helps and motivates you. This article will end by giving you tips and additional information that can help you, especially when pursuing the YouTube industry.</p><p>Remember that you can only leave comments on videos that are public (or unlisted ones). Additionally, once you leave a comment, it becomes public and is linked to your YouTube account. Make sure your message is in the appropriate tone if you’re representing your company, such as this example from a meditation center playing chillhop music.</p><p>Because understanding how to comment is only one aspect of the issue; very important is knowing how to comment well. A brand’s YouTube remark should provide value beyond simply attempting to sell something.</p><p>Try making a joke, pointing out something amusing, providing helpful information, or expressing sympathy or concern for a fan. Additionally, a simple thumbs-up or heart can go a long way to demonstrate that you are paying attention even if you aren’t feeling very friendly (we all have bad days, it’s OK!).</p><h2 id="Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is-1"><a href="#Did-you-know-what-a-Highlighted-comment-is-1" class="headerlink" title="Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?"></a>Did you know what a Highlighted comment is?</h2><p>A highlighted comment on YouTube aims to draw the content creator’s attention with an automated feature.</p><p>When you click over to the comments area after receiving a notification about a new comment or a reply to one of your comments, that particular comment will be highlighted for quick access.</p><p>To put it another way, YouTube flags notable comments for you to ensure that new messages or significant replies aren’t lost in the noise. Once you have read or replied to the comment, the highlight will go.</p><p>Additionally, video creators can manually highlight commenters to mark them for later responses. To do this, click on the comment’s timestamp (found next to the commenter’s username).

You will not find any button on its frame, not even the power button so it appears very clean. Everything can be handled with automatic tweak settings and it is also possible to manage most of the things via Mac OS also. Behind the screen, there are stereo speakers that ensure incredible performance.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2.Ports and Connectivity"></a>2.Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-ultrafine-4k-monitor-ports.jpg"                      alt="Lg-ultrafine-4k-monitor-ports"                ></p><p> You must be curious to know about the connectivity options available with this fine line monitor. There are two options: Thunderbolt 3 ports and USB type port. You can access its USB-C port to manage power, audio and data transfers even with single cable. That means you can charge your MacBook directly from this monitor. Note that, the USB-C port cannot work same as ThunderBolt 3 that allows users to enjoy much higher transfer speeds but this port stays restricted to MacBook Pro. You will not be able to find DisplayPort and HDMI connection options on this monitor but it just enhances design and saves more space.</p><p> Here, you will be transmitting data and videos on USB-C port instead of using ThunderBolt 3. This type of connectivity limits the expected capabilities of this monitor as one can enjoy lesser bandwidth where USB-C port follows speed range of USB 2.0 port.</p><h4 id="3-Image-Quality"><a href="#3-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3.Image Quality"></a>3.Image Quality</h4><p> If we call this display same as that of Apple products then the indication is directly towards its quality. Right from the moment when you turn this monitor ON for the very first time, it appears brilliant, vibrant and bright with impressively managed colours on every portion of the screen. Those who are using the retina type displays of MacBooks from several years will find this screen perfect for their needs as they need not to compromise for low resolution. This UltraFine display monitor can handle P3 color gamut that leads to incredible results for videos as well as images. It means you will find this monitor perfectly suitable to access your mobile photography with deep details. This LG monitor has matte black look on borders and that give ultimate impression. The glossy screen makes stunning color popup but this screen is not much suitable for bright locations. This 21.5” monitor can handle 4,096x2,304 resolution level with crisp details. You can access the scaling feature of MacBook to improve its text size up to readable level.</p><h4 id="4-Multi-Function-Screen-Manager"><a href="#4-Multi-Function-Screen-Manager" class="headerlink" title="4.Multi Function Screen Manager"></a>4.Multi Function Screen Manager</h4><p> Here is one important thing to note about LG UltraFine 4K monitor; manufacturers have designed it to work perfectly with MacOS with multi function screen manager option. That means, users can easily divide their monitor screen into 2 to 4 frames so that multiple things can be accessed at a time without facing any complexity in handling. All the screens get well arranged on this monitor and the displays appear perfectly fine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151893/7443" target="_top" id="2151893">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151893" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151893/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Compatible-with-Windows"><a href="#Compatible-with-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Compatible with Windows?"></a>Compatible with Windows?</h2><p> Now, this must be the most important question in every reader’s mind. Those who have PCs at their home must be thinking to find better connectivity options on windows. So the great news is that there is no technical issue related to such connection. But we have few reasons that limit your usage on windows.</p><p> You will find several monitors that are designed with classic colour profiles. Note that, if these monitors do not find a computer that can handle extended gamut then they keep on reflecting back the details to sRGB mechanism. This is a big trouble. But when you connect such high end monitors with MacOS then you will be able to handle everything via specially designed software AppKit. It helps to make perfect negotiation with the monitor color information and everything on screen appears good. Thus, it is better to use this monitor with MacOS only.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136536/16384" target="_top" id="2136536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136536/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> If you already own the 12” MacBook of Apple then this LG Ultrafine display unit is best choice for you.

How to add a timestamp in YouTube comments or description"></a>Part 2. How to add a timestamp in YouTube comments or description</h2><p>If you are a Youtuber and your videos are informative, adding a jumpable timestamp in the comments or description will make it easier for viewers to understand your videos. The duration of your video will also grow if viewers keep returning to a certain piece of it.</p><p>Here’s the guide to adding a timestamp to a YouTube comment or description:</p><ol><li>Select the time you want to link to</li><li>Pause the video and note the time</li><li>Write the time in the comment</li><li>Post your comment</li></ol><p>The process is simple - just write the time you want to redirect viewers to in the comment. The timestamp format is hours:minutes:seconds (no spaces). Make sure the time format is correct, then a timestamp with a jump link will be generated automatically.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>YouTubers want videos to be short and to the point. However, if the video needs to be longer, you can help users browse and find what’s important to them by adding a timestamp to the YouTube link or a timestamp to the YouTube descriptions. This can help your viewers go directly to the interesting part of the video instead of watching the entire video, saving them time, and improving the user experience. The most recommended way to the timestamp on YouTube is using a built-in function in YouTube.</p><p>Timestamps can help you share information with your audience without having to watch unimportant segments. If you’re only focusing on a certain part of the video, you can link directly to it to save time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Part 1.

However, if the video needs to be longer, you can help users browse and find what’s important to them by adding a timestamp to the YouTube link or a timestamp to the YouTube descriptions. This can help your viewers go directly to the interesting part of the video instead of watching the entire video, saving them time, and improving the user experience. The most recommended way to the timestamp on YouTube is using a built-in function in YouTube.</p><p>Timestamps can help you share information with your audience without having to watch unimportant segments. If you’re only focusing on a certain part of the video, you can link directly to it to save time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-from-play-to-watch-recording-with-a-nintendo-switch-for-2024/"><u>[New] From Play to Watch Recording with a Nintendo Switch for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-full-length-video-view-remove-youtube-preview/"><u>[New] Full-Length Video View Remove YouTube Preview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-ultimate-collection-of-top-asmr-microphones/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Collection of Top ASMR Microphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-newbies-blueprint-to-mastering-av1/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved A Newbie's Blueprint to Mastering AV1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-detailed-evaluation-gopro-silver-hero4-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Detailed Evaluation GoPro Silver Hero4 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-live-stream-tools-xsplit-or-obs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Live Stream Tools XSplit or OBS?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-newcomers-roadmap-thriving-on-youtube-and-your-wallet/"><u>[Updated] The Newcomer's Roadmap Thriving on YouTube and Your Wallet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leveraging-social-influence-a-guide-to-biz-success-on-snap/"><u>2024 Approved Leveraging Social Influence A Guide to Biz Success on Snap</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/4-easy-ways-for-your-vivo-x100-pro-hard-reset-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>4 Easy Ways for Your Vivo X100 Pro Hard Reset | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/global-vr-landscape-recent-developments/"><u>Global VR Landscape Recent Developments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/ideal-dslrs-for-animation-filmmaking/"><u>Ideal DSLRs for Animation Filmmaking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-ways-on-how-to-unlockbypassswiperemove-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-fingerprint-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Ways on How to Unlock/Bypass/Swipe/Remove Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G Fingerprint Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-dynamic-gimbal-support-for-smooth-captures-anywhere/"><u>In 2024, Dynamic Gimbal Support for Smooth Captures Anywhere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfect-harmony-in-canvas-cropping-adding-music-to-video/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Harmony in Canvas Cropping, Adding Music to Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-streamline-iphone-videos-size-and-length-optimization/"><u>In 2024, Streamline iPhone Videos Size & Length Optimization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/navigating-the-process-of-enlisting-videos-on-youtube-shelves-for-2024/"><u>Navigating the Process of Enlisting Videos on YouTube Shelves for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/step-by-step-instructions-fixing-the-phoenix-point-sudden-shutdown-problem/"><u>Step-by-Step Instructions: Fixing the Phoenix Point Sudden Shutdown Problem</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

For instance, if you own a clothing brand and want to do advertising for the brand, you can change the color of outfits with a single click to save your time.</p><p>So instead of hiring various models, you can still display your collection by changing the color of outfits tactfully. In this article, we will discuss the tips to change photo color effortlessly through a photo color editor and online tool.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Tips-To-Change-Photo-Color-Like-A-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-Tips-To-Change-Photo-Color-Like-A-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Tips To Change Photo Color Like A Pro"></a>Part 1: Tips To Change Photo Color Like A Pro</h2><p>In this section, we will give you some beneficial tips and guidelines to change the photo color through <a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" >Adobe Photoshop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Then use Adobe Photoshop and open its main interface. Go to its “Quick Selection” tool and select around the shirt to change its color. Now go to the bottom right and click on “New Adjustment Layer,” and tap on “Hue and Saturation.”</p><p>On the tab of hue and saturation, you can use hue, saturation, and brightness to change the color of your selected shirt.

Start with duplicating the existing layer and then hiding the second layer. Double click on the layer to open the menu and then use “Blend IF” sliders. This option works when you drag the sliders to black points, and it automatically hides the dark pixels of your photo.</p><p>Similarly, if you drag the “Blend IF” sliders towards white pints, it can hide the light pixels. To hide any specific color from the picture, you can click on “Channels” and then select the color you want to eradicate completely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-9.jpg"                      alt="select the channel color"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886044/19272" target="_top" id="1886044">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886044" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886044/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This method only hides color based on their luminance values; however, this loads the entire layer when loading the active pixels. Regardless, this can be changed into transparency. For this, you need to select the layer by right-clicking and selecting the option of “Convert to Smart Object.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-10.jpg"                      alt="convert to smart object"                ></p><p>It helps the user create transparency across the layer. After hiding the layer and coming back to another object-specific layer, you can create a certain change in effect through adjustment layers. For instance, you can create a “Hue and Saturation” adjustment layer. With the above settings, Photoshop applies this as a layer mask for you. Use the sliders across the set layer to change the color across the selected areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-11.jpg"                      alt="select your new color"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137227/26400" target="_top" id="2137227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137227/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors"><a href="#7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors" class="headerlink" title="7.

If you are looking for a large screen as well as some of the fastest processing power from a Samsung device, this is a premium phone that also comes with a premium price. Working to compete with Apple, the iPhone seven as well as other flagship phones is a very difficult process in the galaxy S8 isn’t perfect. It is however a dramatic shift for Samsung.</p><ul><li><a href="#section1">Section 1: Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware Design</a></li><li><a href="#section2">Section 2: Samsung Galaxy S8 Features and Performance</a></li><li><a href="#section3">Section 3: Samsung Galaxy S8 Onboard Software</a></li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y14T5YW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06Y14T5YW&linkId=01db8297751893b9921ba30138d3f180" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Pros-and-cons"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Pros-and-cons" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy S8 Pros and cons"></a>Samsung Galaxy S8 Pros and cons</h2><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>The first and most recognizable feature of this device is the large display with its bezel free design.</li><li>The S8 comes with incredible power on board as well.</li><li>The camera produces some beautiful photos even if you don’t consider yourself a photographer.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Biometric unlocking can become a tedious security feature.</li><li>One of the most expensive phones on the market</li><li>The Bixby feature is largely pointless.</li></ul><h2 id="Section-1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Hardware-Design"><a href="#Section-1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware Design"></a>Section 1: Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Design"><a href="#1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Design" class="headerlink" title="1.Samsung Galaxy S8 Design"></a>1.Samsung Galaxy S8 Design</h4><p>The body design is unlike anything you’ve ever seen on this device. The curved screen, as well as the design without bezels, is truly something to both hold. It’s probably one of the most beautiful smartphones on the market from a design perspective. This screen offers some of the sharpest clarity and color production on any natural phone.</p><p>Everything in the design of this phone is done at a premium. If you’re going be upgrading from a galaxy S5 or switching over from an older iPhone you will feel as though you’re living in the future. The glass on the front is curved on both sides rounded with a glossy style feature and this could very well become the new standard. This style of screen is extremely easy to get adjusted with as well.</p><p>The metal rim and the quality glass and weight to the phone really just make it feel like a premium device and it certainly is with a price tag sometimes in excess of $1100 US. Each of the buttons on the phone are extremely well-crafted as well. Samsung removed a number of keys and included some new keys on the phone to improve the tactile feeling and durability. The only real button that can sometimes get in the way is the Bixby information screen. This button seems to get in the way and start up the Bixby voice recognition app regularly. This is really the only detraction from the overall design and style with the power button still found on the right-hand side in good placement, volume rocker on the left-hand side as well as a fingerprint scanner in a fairly sensible area right next to the camera. USB c connections can be found in the bottom.</p><p>A standard headphone jack can still be found at the top of this device as well.</p><h4 id="2-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Display"><a href="#2-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Display" class="headerlink" title="2.Samsung Galaxy S8 Display"></a>2.Samsung Galaxy S8 Display</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-s8-design.jpg"                      alt="samsung-s8-design"                ></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a display that is known for being particularly stunning. It can deliver beautiful black and white contrast tones as well as very rich colors. Do yourself a favor and start streaming content in HD as soon as you get this device.</p><p>With a screen free of any black space the phone offers a 5.8 inch display which is one of the biggest on the market. The 18.5:9 ratio delivers a completely unique look on a smart phone especially when many applications and videos are made to fit a 16 :9 widescreen. Nevertheless Samsung handles this conversion very well and delivers wonderful entertainment experiences.</p><p>The device is certified by UHT alliance and delivers HDR compatible display. The only problem is that there currently aren’t any HDR compatible applications or videos apart from the ones that you might actually shoot on this camera.</p><h4 id="3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Hardware"><a href="#3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="3.Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware"></a>3.Samsung Galaxy S8 Hardware</h4><p>The hardware on this device is equally as impressive with a Snapdragon 835 standard processor that delivers industry-leading performance. It also comes with a standard 64 GB of HD storage with the chance to expand via the SD memory card of your choice. It’s possible to extend the memory of this phone with a 256 GB card for nearly endless possibilities with filming content, downloading apps and more.</p><p>It may not have the same amount of RAM that you might find in a Oneplus 5 but with 4 GB of onboard RAM the device does fine when paired with this processor. It can run through some of the worlds most demanding applications as well as display HD content with ease.</p><p>The battery on board is kept to just a 3000mAH option which is lower than some of the other competitors but the device does have a number of power saving techniques within Android as well as the efficiency of the hardware itself.</p><p>In many stress tests with this phone even with high-rise display it can deliver improved sharpness as well as handle a large load of tasks. It is one of the best speced phones on the market and it produces some of the best benchmark results available today.</p><p>To make connectivity even better the S8 is equipped with Bluetooth five which improves range, control and even the option for improved smart home automation.</p><h4 id="4-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Durability"><a href="#4-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Durability" class="headerlink" title="4. Samsung Galaxy S8 Durability"></a>4. Samsung Galaxy S8 Durability</h4><p>The phone comes with a very durable design that is created to be waterproof. With the full certification on waterproofing this is maybe not a device that you would use for diving but it can stand up to light rain, splashing and other situations. The majority of the device is made out of an aluminum instruction with the front of the device being constructed out of Gorilla Glass 5. The weight and the durability of this device is not something to question as it can deliver the best in performance throughout a standard day.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Section-2-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Samsung Galaxy S8 Features and Performance"></a>Section 2: Samsung Galaxy S8 Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Camera-Performance"><a href="#1-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Camera-Performance" class="headerlink" title="1. Samsung Galaxy S8 Camera Performance"></a>1. Samsung Galaxy S8 Camera Performance</h4><p>The camera in the Galaxy S8 hasn’t been upgraded that much since previous versions of the Galaxy. On board comes a 12 megapixel camera in the rear of the Samsung device as well as an eight megapixel sensor in the front facing camera. The device is other software have been upgraded fairly substantially and this means producing photos that have great contrast and edits done almost automatically on the phone. Although the specs have not been upgraded Samsung has really zeroed in on the right types of cameras to use in their devices.</p><p>Some of the photos that were taken in tests tend to look a little bit over exposed but overall the device handles taking photos in all types of lighting very well. Double tapping the power button will instantly open up the camera app to make for quick photos. With the onboard performance it’s also possible to capture images in less than a second. Quick shortcuts as well as an even quicker photo app ensures that you can always capture the shot even when you are pressed for time.</p><p>If you want to edit your 4K video footage on Galaxy S8, or you want to make video with the photos you shot with Galaxy S8, we recommend you to try Filmora, which will make a video for you within one minutes. It is easy to use yet powerful enough. Besides the basic video editing features, such as trimming, splitting, rotating, cutting, cropping and reversing, it also provides themes, overlays, filters, transitions and elements for you to use. You can also add text and titles, and voiceover to your video, or make a PIP video.</p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.filmorago"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg"                      alt="Download filmora"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111995/7443" target="_top" id="2111995">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111995" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111995/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>However, if you are looking for a more advanced video editing tool to make a video on your PC, you should not miss <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Samsung Galaxy S8 Audio Performance"></a>2. Samsung Galaxy S8 Audio Performance</h4><p>The inclusion of the newest Bluetooth features allows the device to easily connect with a variety of others to deliver unprecedented sound. It actually possible the connected to different Bluetooth speakers at once using the S8 to produce a stereo sound equivalent. The onboard speaker is relatively strong but it is these Bluetooth features that really improved the sound on the phone and the type of sounds that you can get watching videos, streaming content and more.</p><p>The sound on board the phone through the music player application and the headphones that come with the device is also extremely strong. While Samsung has always produced relatively strong speakers in its smartphone considerable changes really haven’t been made with the S8 apart from the Bluetooth inclusion.</p><h4 id="3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Battery-Performance"><a href="#3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Battery-Performance" class="headerlink" title="3. Samsung Galaxy S8 Battery Performance"></a>3. Samsung Galaxy S8 Battery Performance</h4><p>With just a 3000 mAh battery on board, most would have expected to see a larger battery. Many suggest that the reason Samsung scaled back the battery is to avoid the chance for explosions and fires that occurred with the note 7. The battery life is fairly good to considering the type of hardware that’s on board. It’s the power saving modes and the efficient hardware that really make this 3000 mAh battery seem like a substantial option.</p><p>More conveniently the S8 does offer wireless charging. If you have a wireless charging platform the process for charging this phone at night or throughout the day is very simple. This extra feature really improves the versatility of this device and ensure is that you can keep it well charged up through the day. There are plenty of ways that you can make sure you don’t ever run out of power even considering the smaller battery on this device.</p><p>It can handle plenty of demanding applications but it’s very important to use the automatic brightness and power saving modes where applicable so that you can save on battery life and make sure that you get the phone through an entire day.</p><h4 id="4-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Security-Performance"><a href="#4-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Security-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4.

One of the only problems that comes with using these biometrics is that you can end up with a device that consistently needs your permission to unlock and access various applications. Setting up the features is relatively easy and can be done at the start during Samsung set up. Most people end up turning off the iris recognition, facial recognition and opt for fingerprint scanning only as of the much more discreet way to unlock the phone.</p><h4 id="5-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Compatibility"><a href="#5-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="5.

For the future of Samsung VR, the screen without a bevel as well as the HD format that this device can deliver offers a considerable advantage in the market. This is a device that has been well optimized for the future of VR.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959773/19272" target="_top" id="1959773">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959773" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959773/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Section-3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Onboard-Software"><a href="#Section-3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Onboard-Software" class="headerlink" title="Section 3: Samsung Galaxy S8 Onboard Software"></a>Section 3: Samsung Galaxy S8 Onboard Software</h2><p>The device comes with a touchwiz UI which is very similar to other Samsung application experiences. The menus are all extremely easy-to-use and the home button and menu buttons on the back really assist with navigation throughout the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-s8-bixby.jpg"                      alt="samsung-s8-bixby"                ></p><p>Bixby is one of the latest highlighted features which is somewhat similar to the brand voice for Samsung. Bixby is an assistant at similar to the Google Assistant, Siri and more. Currently Bixby really just delivers a number of different alerts and reminders. The one feature that is fairly interested is the Bixby vision which can examine items in a store and help you comparison shop as well as the ongoing reminders and calendar updates. The current version of Bixby is pretty light but Samsung hopes to eventually include actions like the ability for Bixby to handle uploading all of your photos to social media or even sending out texts and alerts. Currently however Bixby is a fairly light app that you won’t likely use often.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148643/16836" target="_top" id="2148643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="75"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148643/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>This is currently one of the best android smart phones available on the market.

Most video editors apply video effects to their artwork for different purposes. Nowadays, videos without effects will probably cause a decrease in audience and supporters. To prevent that, editors keep seeking the best video effects for their videos.</p><p>There are many sources of video effects. Some are included in the video editing software, and you can find some on the internet. There are also video effects that can give a more realistic effect, which is probably a premium one, and you need to spend money to get that video effect in your hands. But if you don’t want to spend money seeking video effects, this article will significantly help you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/free-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="free video effects"                ></p><p>This composition will give you some information on how you will be able to download video effects without spending money.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">How does VFX differ from SFX?</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">When to use SFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">When to use VFX</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Get Free Video Effects?</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Pixabay.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Pexels.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mixkit.co</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Videezy.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">Videvo.net</a></li></ol><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-are-Video-Effects"><a href="#What-are-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Effects?"></a>What are Video Effects?</h2><p>The acronym VFX stands for video effects. The term “visual effects,” also known as “VFX,” refers to all types of digitally enhanced pictures, from adding backdrops using greenscreen to incorporating GGI models and entities. In filmmaking and video production, visual effects refer to how imagery is created or altered outside of a live-action shot.</p><h3 id="How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX"><a href="#How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX" class="headerlink" title="How does VFX differ from SFX?"></a>How does VFX differ from SFX?</h3><p>These concepts are frequently ambiguous; therefore, we wanted to examine this subject in greater detail to clarify any misunderstandings.</p><p>Usually, you can infer from the context which “kind” of VFX is being discussed. When debates about when to employ one method over another or whether to use both ways to accomplish an effect in a shot emerge, SFX and VFX are frequently used jointly in a production.</p><p>Both SFX and VFX are tools that let you strengthen your story’s narrative. Your production will probably require either or both of the solutions mentioned earlier. How, though, can you tell which is best for your project?</p><h3 id="When-to-use-SFX"><a href="#When-to-use-SFX" class="headerlink" title="When to use SFX"></a>When to use SFX</h3><p>Special effects transport viewers to a simpler era of movie and television production. SFX was used—and is frequently still used—to improve a scene or set piece. Things that might occur haphazardly in real life but need careful planning on the set include an explosion, fire, or a rainy day in a love story. On-set special effects are frequently used to generate snow, rain or to add smoke to a scene. The addition of fire, either to decorate sets or to be employed in a stunt involving people, is another component of the SFX skill set.</p><h3 id="When-to-use-VFX"><a href="#When-to-use-VFX" class="headerlink" title="When to use VFX"></a>When to use VFX</h3><p>Then why would you need to use digitally created snow, fire, rain, or other effects as VFX if SFX recorded on camera are so effective?</p><p>It might be one scenario if you had a larger canvas to fill and more images to take. Using VFX to produce a snowy landscape with expansive views will be simpler and less expensive. The same holds with rain.</p><p>Then it would be best if you contemplate the circumstances that exist on-set. If you add smoke to a scene to help it come to life—say, a fight scene in a historical drama—the wind may blow it away, or it might not “behave” the way you want it to. You will then require VFX smoke. On-set SFX cannot be “ordered” to act in a manner that the director, production crew, or writers deem appropriate for the plot.</p><p>Another problem is that artificial snow and set smoke can occasionally make actors unresponsive. Snow machines aren’t always suited for every situation because they may also be pretty noisy.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Video Effects?"></a>How to Get Free Video Effects?</h2><p>Video effects are primarily included in your downloaded video editing software. But if you just downloaded a free video editing software, the video effects included are usually limited and sometimes superficial. Many video editing software offers premium video effects, which is undoubtedly not disappointing, but you have to spend money for a subscription to unlock all the features of that software.</p><p>This composition will show you how to get free video effects from different websites. Remember that it is free, so you should not expect more because, you know, the cooler and more realistic the video effect, the greater its value.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036467/19272" target="_top" id="2036467">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036467" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036467/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Pixabay-com"><a href="#1-Pixabay-com" class="headerlink" title="1.

When debates about when to employ one method over another or whether to use both ways to accomplish an effect in a shot emerge, SFX and VFX are frequently used jointly in a production.</p><p>Both SFX and VFX are tools that let you strengthen your story’s narrative. Your production will probably require either or both of the solutions mentioned earlier. How, though, can you tell which is best for your project?</p><h3 id="When-to-use-SFX-1"><a href="#When-to-use-SFX-1" class="headerlink" title="When to use SFX"></a>When to use SFX</h3><p>Special effects transport viewers to a simpler era of movie and television production. SFX was used—and is frequently still used—to improve a scene or set piece. Things that might occur haphazardly in real life but need careful planning on the set include an explosion, fire, or a rainy day in a love story. On-set special effects are frequently used to generate snow, rain or to add smoke to a scene. The addition of fire, either to decorate sets or to be employed in a stunt involving people, is another component of the SFX skill set.</p><h3 id="When-to-use-VFX-1"><a href="#When-to-use-VFX-1" class="headerlink" title="When to use VFX"></a>When to use VFX</h3><p>Then why would you need to use digitally created snow, fire, rain, or other effects as VFX if SFX recorded on camera are so effective?</p><p>It might be one scenario if you had a larger canvas to fill and more images to take. Using VFX to produce a snowy landscape with expansive views will be simpler and less expensive. The same holds with rain.</p><p>Then it would be best if you contemplate the circumstances that exist on-set. If you add smoke to a scene to help it come to life—say, a fight scene in a historical drama—the wind may blow it away, or it might not “behave” the way you want it to. You will then require VFX smoke. On-set SFX cannot be “ordered” to act in a manner that the director, production crew, or writers deem appropriate for the plot.</p><p>Another problem is that artificial snow and set smoke can occasionally make actors unresponsive. Snow machines aren’t always suited for every situation because they may also be pretty noisy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972698/19272" target="_top" id="1972698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects-1"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Video Effects?"></a>How to Get Free Video Effects?</h2><p>Video effects are primarily included in your downloaded video editing software.

Most third-party media players do showcase the SRT-based format easily. So, you can also use Preview apps or any other software to access and read the basic text documents on Mac.</p><p>However, the QuickTime player on Mac does not always support SRT in videos.

This guide will show you how to use Microsoft Word, <strong>as well as 5 other online tools</strong>, to easily remove the background of any signature.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Using-Microsoft-Word-as-a-Fast-Signature-Background-Remover"><a href="#Using-Microsoft-Word-as-a-Fast-Signature-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="Using Microsoft Word as a Fast Signature Background Remover"></a>Using Microsoft Word as a Fast Signature Background Remover</h2><p>Microsoft Word is one of the best options.

Then, go to the menu at the top and hit <strong>Format.</strong> Look to the upper-left corner and click on <strong>Corrections.</strong> Then, set the parameters exactly as in this image. 馃憞</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/signature-background-settings.png"                      alt="remove background from signature in word"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Crop-the-Image-and-Save-It"><a href="#Step3Crop-the-Image-and-Save-It" class="headerlink" title="Step3Crop the Image and Save It"></a>Step3Crop the Image and Save It</h5><p>Lastly, you should crop out the white spaces near the corners of the signature image. Just select the image and click on <strong>Crop</strong> from the upper-right corner of the screen. Use the black lines around it to crop it.</p><p>Then, from the Format menu at the top, click on <strong>Compress Pictures.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/compress-picture.png"                      alt="compress pictures button in word"                ></p><p>After this, make sure to select the settings as follows:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/compress-picture-settings.png"                      alt="word compress pictures settings"                ></p><p>The only thing that’s left to do now is to save the image.

In case it is missing, check whether it is active from the Window tab located at the top of your main menu.

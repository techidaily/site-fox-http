Also think if how the content information really good, you should also think of your editing, most especially the choice of background music to set the good mood in the video and also to your viewers who watches your video. Putting background music to your video’s specially of the silent part of the video will give you and your video a unique vitality. But also remember to be very careful on using background music or sites where you take to use the music for your vlogs because not all the application software has passed YouTube’s partner programmed, your channel might be down or disapproved for monetization.</p><p>In this article we’re going to give you an idea on where you can get a free background music without worrying of copyrighted issue.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Background-Music-is-Important"><a href="#Why-Background-Music-is-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why Background Music is Important"></a>Why Background Music is Important</h2><ul><li>Music is a huge part of what makes this content so engaging</li><li>Music takes your video to the next level</li><li>Background music is a smooth way to fill in moments that would otherwise be silent</li><li>Fill dead air when you have a visual but no sound.</li><li>Music sets the tone and inspire emotion</li><li>The music can help make a video feel long and sad or useful and informative</li><li>Help to boost the production value and cohesiveness of your video content</li><li>Help connect to your viewers with the content.</li><li>It add a little extra flavor and spice to your learning experience</li><li>Music is efficient to induce positive emotion and modulate mood</li></ul><h2 id="What-is-Royalty-Free-Music"><a href="#What-is-Royalty-Free-Music" class="headerlink" title="What is Royalty-Free Music?"></a>What is Royalty-Free Music?</h2><p><strong>Royalty-free music</strong></p><p>Is music that can be used without having to pay royalties. This music requires a one off payment or, as in the case of Epidemic Sound a recurring subscription fee.</p><p>However, royalty-free music is not cost free. The term just means that users don’t have to pay a royalty each time they use the music. Royalty-Free music simply helps users avoid the pitfalls that can result from trying to navigate complex licensing requirements.</p><h2 id="Places-to-find-Background-Music"><a href="#Places-to-find-Background-Music" class="headerlink" title="Places to find Background Music"></a>Places to find Background Music</h2><p><strong>YouTube Audio Library</strong></p><p>If you have a YouTube channel then its good to go, in YouTube Audio Library you can access more than 150,000 free tracks.

That means you can use everything provided you give him credit. He even has an attribution template for you to use on his FAQ page. If you don’t want to provide attribution, you can purchase a license.</p><p>Music here focusses on music for film, so many of the categories and description refer to film genres, like Western or horror. If you’re working on a cinematic project, you might find the perfect track here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-music-freepd.jpg"                      alt="preview music freepd"                ></p><p><strong>Epidemic Sound</strong></p><p>If you’re also looking for high quality background music for your videos consider Epidemic Sound.

There are so many things to consider when it comes to what makes good background music. What’s the tone of your content, and who is the audience?</p><p>Consider if you are a Product reviewer or explainer use subtle music to maintain the attention of your viewer to the information and product demo. If you are action Vlogger or doing daily lifestyle Vlog, use clear music to explain and advance the plot.</p><p>Remember choose music that speaks to your audience, the more you know about your audience’s age, affiliations, and preferences, the more specific you can be about your music choice. If your viewers cover wide swath of professionals in business, it’s best to play it safe with corporate tones. Classic rock, and ambient music. But if you know that they’re younger hip hop and dance music might be more appropriate.</p><p>Editing Software the has Royalty-free stock music</p><p>Background music is the bridge that allows the video to transition smoothly between different ideas or scenes, especially when you have a jump cut</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006914/19272" target="_top" id="2006914">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006914" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006914/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Editing-software-with-Royalty-free-background-music"><a href="#Editing-software-with-Royalty-free-background-music" class="headerlink" title="Editing software with Royalty-free background music"></a>Editing software with Royalty-free background music</h2><p>Video editing is essential to all vloggers or content creator, you need to find a software that has license and won’t ruin your channel someday.

Since then, the term and the need for podcast SEO have grown among podcast hosts, marketers, and SEO professionals.</p><p>So, if you have been wondering what search engine podcast is, how it can help your episodes appear in the top searches, the tactics to optimize the same, and everything else, stay with us.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Podcast-SEO"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Podcast-SEO" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Podcast SEO?"></a>Part 1. What is Podcast SEO?</h2><p>SEO stands for search engine optimization. Your website, blog, and other pages can be found by brand-new visitors or lead if you have optimized your pages for search terms.</p><p>Like any other content, podcasts are also created to be successful and reach audiences worldwide. As such, podcast SEO refers to improving the visibility of your podcasts in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-Google-Show-Podcasts-in-SERPs"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-Google-Show-Podcasts-in-SERPs" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Does Google Show Podcasts in SERPs?"></a>Part 2. Why Does Google Show Podcasts in SERPs?</h2><p>Over the years, podcasts have become an essential form of media content that covers various topics to be discussed, ranging from learning new skill sets, current affairs, music, comedy, and much more.</p><p>However, podcast hosts have found it challenging to promote their audio content. Not to mention making their podcasts more reachable around the world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast seo"                ></p><p>Considering this struggle of the podcasters, Google in the year 2019 announced that podcasts can now be indexed in SERPs. New promotion opportunities thus opened for all podcast creators and marketers.</p><p>Similarly to how videos are being searched, podcasts can also be displayed in desktop and mobile search results. Moreover, SERPs allow podcast episodes to be played without switching to another page by showing them as featured snippets. Thus, it is much easier for people to look for, and discover the podcast by simply a relevant keyword.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Podcast-SEO-Tips-How-to-Optimize-Your-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Podcast-SEO-Tips-How-to-Optimize-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Podcast SEO Tips: How to Optimize Your Content"></a>Part 3. Podcast SEO Tips: How to Optimize Your Content</h2><p>If you want your podcasts to rank high on SERPs and get organic traffic, you need to optimize them smartly. Here are some podcast SEO tips you can use, and we’ve shortlisted the best.</p><h3 id="1-Keeping-an-eye-on-the-trends"><a href="#1-Keeping-an-eye-on-the-trends" class="headerlink" title="1. Keeping an eye on the trends"></a>1. Keeping an eye on the trends</h3><p>To ensure your podcast is searchable on Google, it has to be in line with the latest and trending topics. Though you can always have podcasts on different topics, focussing on the latest trends will surely help you get higher ranks in search engine results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="keeping an eye on trends"                ></p><h3 id="2-Transcription-matters"><a href="#2-Transcription-matters" class="headerlink" title="2. Transcription matters"></a>2. Transcription matters</h3><p>Another vital factor to be considered for podcast SEO is transcription. When the audio file is scanned, the podcasts episodes transcriptions are done by Google. However, to have complete control over the translation, transcribing audio to texts is suggested.</p><p>While transcribing podcasts, you can consider several factors like correct terminology, relevant terms, the right keywords, and more. With the right transcription, the accessibility of the podcast increases.</p><p>One Windows and Mac-based software that can help you with this task is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Also, select the files that have to be converted. Also, check the option to match the timeline automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-7.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora stt step 2"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Task-list-and-file-generation"><a href="#Step3-Task-list-and-file-generation" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Task list and file generation"></a>Step3 Task list and file generation</h5><p>Once the transcoding and transcription are complete, a task list will be displayed with the first imported file at the top. Sliding it up and down is supported. The file that is generated will now be displayed in the SRT format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora stt step 3"                ></p><h3 id="3-Add-relevant-keywords"><a href="#3-Add-relevant-keywords" class="headerlink" title="3. Add relevant keywords"></a>3. Add relevant keywords</h3><p>After getting the transcription, keywords are the next to think about. Keywords are like the lifeline to any content, and podcast is no exception. So, adding the relevant keywords related to your topic and the ones commonly searched by the user will help you rank higher in the search results.</p><p>Spend some time and research to find the relevant keywords for your podcasts, and for a help of professional keyword generators can also be taken. Some popular ones that can be considered are Google Keyword Planner, Semrush, Google Search Console, SECockpit, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="add relevant keywords"                ></p><p>Besides finding the keywords, their right placement is also critical. In addition to the podcast name, the keywords can be added to the titles, descriptions, etc. Also, keywords density and variants matter. Make sure not to use the same ones repeatedly in a single paragraph.</p><p>And using keyword variants will increase your reach and will also help you to avoid stuffing. For example, if the keyword is “video editors”, then “video editing”, “video makers”, “editors for videos”, etc., can all be inserted into your transcription. The keywords can also be added to the description and show notes.</p><h3 id="4-Leveraging-podcast-metadata"><a href="#4-Leveraging-podcast-metadata" class="headerlink" title="4. Leveraging podcast metadata"></a>4. Leveraging podcast metadata</h3><p>Metadata helps in providing additional details about your content and is a useful tool for podcast SEO. The metadata appears after the title and provides the podcast episode information, like what the podcast is about, its content, and more.</p><p>Keywords can also be added to the metadata. With these details, the search engines can get a quick understanding of your content and topic and thus help in better search and ranking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="metadata leveraging"                ></p><h3 id="5-Authoritative-quality-content"><a href="#5-Authoritative-quality-content" class="headerlink" title="5. Authoritative quality content"></a>5. Authoritative quality content</h3><p>Google always promotes the content that it founds to be authoritative; for this, the Google algorithm should recognize you as the leader in the industry. To match up with the Google algorithm, you need quality content that offers useful and correct information and appeals to the audience.</p><p>So, lay your major focus on the quality content rather than the quantity to establish yourself as the leader. Thus, authoritative quality control is another effective <strong>podcast</strong> SEO technique.</p><h3 id="6-Link-and-promote-on-social-media"><a href="#6-Link-and-promote-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="6. Link and promote on social media"></a>6. Link and promote on social media</h3><p>You can increase your podcast’s exposure and reach by cross-promoting it on social media platforms. With your content on social media sites, your chances of getting discovered and found by different search engines increase.</p><p>Plan your social media strategy based on your topic and the target audience to get maximum shares, likes, and comments. With your podcasts appearing on multiple channels, chances of getting pulled by Google on search engine results increase.</p><p>You can promote your podcasts on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others and convert them to be fit for YouTube as a downloadable e-book, blog post, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/seo-for-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="social media promotion"                ></p><h3 id="7-Make-a-website-or-a-page-for-your-podcast"><a href="#7-Make-a-website-or-a-page-for-your-podcast" class="headerlink" title="7. Make a website or a page for your podcast"></a>7.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unveiling-the-Power-of-Video-Enhancement-SDR-to-Dynamic-Range-Upconversion"><a href="#Unveiling-the-Power-of-Video-Enhancement-SDR-to-Dynamic-Range-Upconversion" class="headerlink" title="Unveiling the Power of Video Enhancement: SDR to Dynamic Range Upconversion"></a>Unveiling the Power of Video Enhancement: SDR to Dynamic Range Upconversion</h2><p><em>“I shot HDR video clips with the camera for my YouTube videos, but part of the footage is SDR, I hope to get a consistent video presentation, how could I do?”</em></p><p><em>So what do you do with all of your existing SDR content? To solve this, SDR to HDR conversion or vice versa can be one of the best solutions. So let’s take a further look at the available options to create amazing upconversions.</em></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR"><a href="#Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?"></a>Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?</h2><p>Before diving into concrete steps, it’s best to have a decent understanding of how it works. Changing from SDR to HDR is possible, but with specific sequences, the results can vary accordingly. Of course, the video’s original quality would influence how it looks in the final outcome, even if you convert it into the high dynamic range or HDR version.</p><p>The camera noise and compression artifacts that are available in the video file will become more enhanced after the upconverting process. This means more clean-up work during and after the processing will become necessary. So, <strong>converting SDR to HDR</strong> successfully from the source file will not change entirely in some methods.</p><p>Given all that, does it even need to convert SDF video into HDR, you may ask. The answer is yes. Here are some reasons why:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark&#x2F;Light Balance</strong></li></ul><p>HDR content assures more light-and-dark balance in the videos&#x2F;images captured compared to the displayed version. The HDR video files have more defined highlights and shadows and noticeable luminance differences in scenes. So, the imagery is more realistic whether one clicks pictures outdoors or indoors, during the day or night.</p><ul><li><strong>3D Effect</strong></li></ul><p>Videos with a high dynamic range have enhanced depth perception. So, the surface objects are more noticeable, with perceptible shadows under the object against the background. Therefore, the files have a three-dimensional effect after you turn <strong>SDR to HDR.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A wide color gamut is available</strong></li></ul><p>HDR video comes with the availability of a wider color gamut that is not supported under SDR. With HDR, it is possible to expand the luminance and contrast levels, and color gradients are more prominent. To note, SDR monitors run with the Rec.709 colorspace spectrum, while HDR supports a wider Rec.2020 colorspace with more color variations.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR"><a href="#Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR"></a>Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR</h3><p>It is possible to <strong>convert SDR to HDR</strong> after the legacy video-based content is mastered or recorded in SDR quality. Here, one can upconvert the content quality to HDR using the inverse tone mapping procedure. There are three content types that fall under the SDR Archive Content version:</p><ul><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content that comes with uncontrolled lighting</strong>. An example here includes Live Outdoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content is available with controlled lighting</strong>. Examples include concerts, studio content recordings, and Indoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>Post-produced or mastered SDR content</strong>. These examples are documentaries and movies.</li></ul><p>Two sequences are available for upconverting SDR content from the archive to HDR. A suitable method would be to use the inverse tone-mapping functionality to set the HDR effect on the SDR content.</p><p>This process makes the SDR clips blend smoothly into the HDR content after you remaster them. You can use the real-time inverse tone-mapping tools and converters to make the SDR to HDR conversion.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software"><a href="#Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software"></a>Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software</h3><p>One of the best ways to convert SDR to HDR is to use video editing software. Not every editor supports SDR to HDR conversion, but <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does, especially with new upgrades since the v.11.5.4 version. Upgrades are visible under BorisFX effects, like the improved split mode function, Denoise effects, etc.</p><p>Additionally, it supports almost all kinds of formats, like MP4, M4V, MPG, VOB, HDR, and WMV. The gamut of tools allows easy customization and editing of the HDR video.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>How to Use Filmora for SDR Video to HDR Conversion?</strong></p><p>Step1Install and open Filmora software on your PC or Mac.</p><p>Step2Press the “New Project” choice.</p><p>Step3Access “Click here to import media” &gt; Insert the SDR-quality video file in MPEG-1&#x2F;MPEG-2&#x2F;MPEG-4 or other video file formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-1.jpg"                      alt="insert sdr video file"                ></p><p>Step4Drag the video to the editing timeline below.</p><p>Step5Make edits like audio ducking, keyframing, chroma key background removal, adding filters, etc.</p><p>Step6Open Effects &gt; BorisFX &gt; Download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-10.jpg"                      alt="open borisfx"                ></p><p>Step7Choose among the newer options like BCC Optical Diffusion, BCC Warp, and BCC Grads and Tints to upconvert to HDR quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-11.jpg"                      alt="upconvert to hdr quality"                ></p><p>Step8Click on the Export button.</p><p>Step9Choose the Local tab and choose the video format for exporting.

These solutions do so when they save different content versions at varying resolutions and are compatible with broadcasting and server&#x2F;on-prem cloud systems.</p><p>When users use a video editing suite with MPEG2 decoding or encoding functions, they can store their SDR content while producing HDR videos.</p><p>This solution is useful for converting HDR-level video content into the legacy format, using on-demand or live pre-recorded material. While content providers are best for SDR to HDR conversion, you can expect better-quality control and monitoring work within the production environment.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Convert-SDR-to-HDR-through-a-Third-party-Encoding-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Convert-SDR-to-HDR-through-a-Third-party-Encoding-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Convert SDR to HDR through a Third-party Encoding Tool"></a>Method 4: Convert SDR to HDR through a Third-party Encoding Tool</h3><p>Speaking of live encoding, you should try out the optimized tool for GUI transcoding, like <a class="link"   href="https://encodegui.com/" >EncodeGUI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This import will save your video clips under a project which you can access at any time you want.</li><li>Another way to import any clips to your project is by clicking on the “+” icon and then selecting the desired file from your camera roll.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-add-media-videoleap.jpg"                      alt="tap add media videoleap"                ></p><ul><li>Now after the video clips are imported and collected, you will see a timeline of clips where everything will be arranged to your initial preferences.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-timeline-videoleap.jpg"                      alt="video timeline videoleap"                ></p><ul><li>Click on the part of the timeline that you want to edit and then select the tool that says “Transform”. This tool is usually present at the bottom of your screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/transform-vdieo-videoleap.jpg"                      alt="transform vdieo videoleap"                ></p><ul><li>Now, in the preview window where all the clips are shown, pinch in or out to zoom into the video or vice versa until you get a desired portion of the screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-into-videoleap.jpg"                      alt="zoom into videoleap"                ></p><ul><li>Now play the video after zooming in by clicking on the “play” button and check whether the zoom effect has been added to your video project or not.</li><li>After you are satisfied, save the project and export it at your preference to your computer.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Animate-the-Zoom-effect-in-Videoleap"><a href="#How-to-Animate-the-Zoom-effect-in-Videoleap" class="headerlink" title="How to Animate the Zoom effect in Videoleap"></a>How to Animate the Zoom effect in Videoleap</h2><p>Sometimes the video contents need a dramatic zoom effect that should take place while the video is still playing. And this is called an animated zoom in the Videoleap application. In other words, using the animated zoom effect in Videoleap, you will be able to zoom into your footage. And a major way to apply this effect is by considering the keyframes of the raw footage. These keyframes help the users by animating a zoom effect while there is a movement taking place in the video. And if you also want to animate the zoom effect in Videoleap, here is how you can do it:</p><ul><li>Open the Videoleap application and click on the “+” icon to import files to the application interface. Then you will be available with the video file on a timeline that you want to edit.</li><li>Now, drag the play head on the timeline where you want to start the zoom effect to take place.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-timeline-videoleap.jpg"                      alt="preview timeline videoleap"                ></p><ul><li>Then select the “keyframes” tool from the toolbar at the bottom of your screen.</li><li>Add the keyframes to the desired portion of the video and then navigate the timecode to the place on the timeline where you want to stop it. After that add another keyframe at that point and pinch in to zoom the video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-keyframes-videoleap.jpg"                      alt="add keyframes videoleap"                ></p><ul><li>Now head to the second time code where you want to focus the subject and then click on it. Then click on the “Preview” icon and see whether it needs further changes.</li><li>When you are satisfied, simply export the project and your animated zoom video will be saved successfully.</li></ul><h2 id="Alternative-way-to-Zoom-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Alternative-way-to-Zoom-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Alternative way to Zoom Video on Computer"></a>Alternative way to Zoom Video on Computer</h2><p>If for some reason you are not able to install and use Videoleap on your system or you want to switch to any other applications, then Filmora is the best available alternative. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a paid video editing application that can be used on a trial basis with limited options.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Grasping-Core-Principles-in-Narrative-Designs"><a href="#Grasping-Core-Principles-in-Narrative-Designs" class="headerlink" title="Grasping Core Principles in Narrative Designs"></a>Grasping Core Principles in Narrative Designs</h2><p>Marketers are always looking for new ways to catch as many people’s attention as possible, and they use urgency, despair, discounted rates, and sales as bait. However, while these may work at first, twice, or even three times, they rarely produce long-term results.</p><p>Incorporating such <strong>storytelling in marketing</strong> captures attention, entices, and encourages potential customers — everything we need to close a sale. In addition, it encourages intimacy and trust — all of the additives for a fulfilling relationship.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-storytelling-in-marketing-sale-conversation.jpg"                      alt="best of storytelling in marketing sale conversation"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Storytelling"><a href="#What-is-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="What is Storytelling?"></a>What is Storytelling?</h2><p>Storytelling is an ancient form of interactive personal expression that expresses the narrative while revealing many images and circumstances to the listener. Stories have always facilitated communication. A good story can also be told effectively using photos, images, and movies.</p><p>In line with this, storytelling also seeks to convey an idea by igniting the audience’s imagination through the storyteller’s words to create an image. Using storytelling, you may even write your own digital story. Therefore, inspiring stories serve as motivators and positively impact individuals’ behavior. The skill and influence of emotional storytelling can alter people’s attitudes, instill loyalty, and inspire them to perform specific actions.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Content Marketing so Important?"></a>Why is Content Marketing so Important?</h2><p>Content marketing improves the company’s online reputation. Viewers are served a variety of content in the form of blog entries, videos, infographics, presentations, and social media posts. By providing value, you draw in the audience while establishing brand trust.</p><p>Below are some reasons why successful content marketing storytelling can increase your company’s success.</p><p><strong>1. Develops a powerful brand personality</strong></p><p>Every brand has specific principles and traits that customers connect with, whether you attempt to or not. A brand personality relates to “who” a consumer is speaking with; as a result, a firm must be genuine, incorporate their worldviews, and explain why it matters in the context of their personal story. Storytelling marketing encourages your clients to feel a part of something bigger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/brand-personality-storytelling-marketing-digital.jpg"                      alt="brand personality in storytelling marketing digital"                ></p><p>The company’s story will be distinctive and interesting to the community if you take risky positions and emphasize your company principles. A memorable marketing narrative can make you stand out in a particular field, making you seem more like a friend than a faceless corporation.</p><p><strong>2. Builds an emotional connection and loyalty with customers</strong></p><p>People can identify with and interact with the finest tales because they feel something; as a result, they invest in the brand and what it advocates. The audience is likelier to like you and your business if they can relate to you or comprehend the steps that went into developing the brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/content-marketing-storytelling-customer-connection.jpg"                      alt="customer connection in content marketing storytelling"                ></p><p>The ability to create emotions through the narrative is a significant weapon since it is kept in mind that people rarely make reasonable judgments. To effectively express your goal, transform it into an engaging story and employ a real storytelling and marketing approach.</p><p><strong>3. Generating new leads</strong></p><p>Lead generation is essential for small businesses because they depend on steady traffic to develop their brand and increase revenue. In addition to being excellent for generating leads, content marketing is also reasonably priced. If your business is working toward objective clients can support, you have a significantly higher chance of success.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/storytelling-and-marketing-generate-new-leads.jpg"                      alt="storytelling and marketing generates new leads"                ></p><p>People prefer to make purchases from organizations they perceive to be sympathetic. It’s simple to see content marketing storytelling’s importance when considering the return on investment. Emotional storytelling reveals your company’s empathy, which will most likely contribute to commercial success.</p><h2 id="How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing"><a href="#How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?"></a>How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?</h2><p>A great storyteller can make a good narrative even more powerful. Therefore, skilled storytellers can captivate their audience, guide them in the right direction, and leave readers or listeners with new information to assimilate and a lesson they may keep for the rest of their existence.</p><p>The techniques listed below will help you become a better storyteller for marketing.</p><p><strong>1. Pick a compelling main point</strong></p><p>The main moral or message of a great story usually develops throughout. When writing a story, you must know what you are aiming to have. No matter what story you want to tell, it’s important to be certain about the central idea or conceit around which it is built.</p><p><strong>2. Have a clear plot structure</strong></p><p>The story’s narrative acts as its main direction. It ensures the story has a beginning, middle, and end and all the enjoyable material; thus, it creates a comfortable environment for your audience and lets people concentrate on other elements of your marketing narrative. A satisfying conclusion will also give your audience a sense of closure. Only if you are positioning yourself for the following chapter is it permissible to leave your character holding to the cliff’s brink.</p><p><strong>3. Show empathy</strong></p><p>Highly empathic individuals who focus on what other people think and feel are excellent storytellers. When telling stories, using empathy can assist you in choosing the most powerful terminology to describe a perspective that focuses on how you believe your use of language would affect an audience.</p><p><strong>4. Make it your own</strong></p><p>Consider providing a personal touch when delivering a narrative, whether it is to entertain or market a product. Your pitch will have the “genuine” factor with a personal touch. It is communicated through a testimonial. If you’re writing a story to entertain the audience, use your personal experiences to enrich the marketing narrative. This tip will give your story a more genuine sense.</p><p><strong>5. Feature appealing characters</strong></p><p>The character must be endearing if you desire your audience to root to see them succeed. Let your audience witness the development of emotions that your character experiences. Nothing is more depressing than a motionless character. Show them whoever your character is rather than telling them.</p><p><strong>6. Engage your audience</strong></p><p>A key component of effective visual storytelling marketing is engaging your audience, but how you do so largely relies on the type of storytelling marketing you’re doing. Consider your audience whenever you decide how to tell your narrative.</p><h2 id="How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally"><a href="#How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally" class="headerlink" title="How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?"></a>How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?</h2><p><strong>1. Text</strong></p><p>Written stories mostly consist of text, though they may also include pertinent imagery. Since this kind of story only needs paper and a pen or even some free writing software like Google Docs, it is also the most accessible and the simplest to write. A blog entry, an essay, and sometimes even a book are effective ways for a written story to reach its intended audience.</p><p>The best example of this type is the “socially aware, designer eyewear at revolutionary pricing” story from <a class="link"   href="https://www.warbyparker.com/history" >Warby Parker. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Instead of merely declaring things are cheap, they provide more context for the assertion by telling a story that explains why they are. He goes so far as to write stories explaining his beginnings on their cleaning cloths, adding a personalized experience and making it more efficient in storytelling and marketing.</p><p><strong>2. Audio</strong></p><p>These stories are very similar to textual stories, except that they are recorded. Technology breakthroughs have made it more accessible than ever to produce audio stories. Podcasts are typically used to tell such a marketing narrative. Great podcasters can blend emotional storytelling into their podcasts to make them entertaining and digestible while inspiring people to act.</p><p>This kind of podcast is exemplified by Camela Thompson from <a class="link"   href="https://calibermind.com/thought-leadership/podcasts/" >CaliberMind’s The Revenue Marketing Report. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Additionally, it is a podcast that primarily serves as a tool for education. On the show’s blogs, the features of each episode are presented, and on the website, you can arrange the episodes by genre.</p><p><strong>3. Photo</strong></p><p>A portion of photographic storytelling includes taking pictures of intriguing situations and events that are difficult to describe in words. These images either convey the tale of a fascinating person or people in an underappreciated setting or take on civil liberties or awareness aspects by highlighting the suffering of those living in impoverished or conflict-torn areas.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Javier-Arcenillas-5e418762e61ba-jpeg%5F%5F880.jpg" >“Latinoamerica,” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a long-term piece by Javier Arcenilla, is an illustration of this kind. The photographer set out to capture the core of unchecked brutality in Latin America, the political and social forces that tenaciously support it, and the will to stop it. It is regarded as one of the best examples of how photography is used in storytelling in marketing.</p><p><strong>4. Video</strong></p><p>The best tools for collecting and sharing emotions are digital stories. Videos are used to narrate these stories. They cost the most to make, considering that they are the most advanced.</p><p>Fortunately, inexpensive video editing software may give your video story a polished, expert appearance without costing a fortune. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a fantastic video editor for creating content marketing storytelling because it has a handy timeline, the option to merge and edit audio and video recordings separately, powerful effects, and the opportunity to customize the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943647/22993" target="_top" id="1943647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong><em>Note: For further details, go to <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/u2i39suoH5c" >Wondershare Filmora 11 | More Than Just You. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484944/16446" target="_top" id="1484944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484944/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour"><a href="#Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour"></a>Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour</h2><p>Content marketing and storytelling go seamlessly together.

Being referred to as Lightroom-style details and controls, this online editor makes a proficient entry across the existing market. It offers a white balance control, which does not come with an auto-slide control tool. However, managing the color and tone across Polarr is quite effective and unique.</p><p>Users can also mainly make proper tone adjustments with the help of shadows, highlights, white balancing, and black sliders. This helps users make prolific changes across their photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/polarr-photo-editor-review-1.jpg"                      alt="adjustment tab of polarr editor"                ></p><h3 id="2-Face-Correction"><a href="#2-Face-Correction" class="headerlink" title="2. Face Correction"></a>2. Face Correction</h3><p>Unlike other online photo editors, Polarr editor does not offer simple editing tools to its users. It is much more about advanced management of the features of the photo that is to be edited. Such is the case with face correction, which can be achieved with the help of the “Retouch” tool. The editing, however, is quite simple and effective to perform.</p><p>Although we might not refer to this tool to be equivalent to the existing desktop tools with similar features, Polarr indeed returns a good result after retouching the photo that contains faces. You won’t be disappointed with it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/polarr-photo-editor-review-2.jpg"                      alt="face correction feature"                ></p><h3 id="3-Effects-and-Overlays"><a href="#3-Effects-and-Overlays" class="headerlink" title="3.

Users who utilize Polarr online for this purpose shall be returned with proper overlays to work with. You can select any of the appropriate effects that you find necessary to make your photo perfect. It will help you make your image look essentially different from the rest.</p><p>If you are looking forward to making quick edits to your photo with effects, you can consider using Polarr for this purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/polarr-photo-editor-review-3.jpg"                      alt="overlays of polarr editor"                ></p><h3 id="4-Sharpen-Your-Photos"><a href="#4-Sharpen-Your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="4. Sharpen Your Photos"></a>4. Sharpen Your Photos</h3><p>This tool has not made a great stand among most online photo editors. Where many have failed to provide the market with the right set of tools for sharpening photos, Polarr online has excelled in this field. The clarity provided through the sliders is commendable and is appreciated by most users.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Is-Product-Review-Vlog-Paid"><a href="#Is-Product-Review-Vlog-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Is Product Review Vlog Paid"></a>Is Product Review Vlog Paid</h2><p>Every time I talk to a friend, they always ask me if everything I do on YouTube is paid? Or are the products that I’m doing a review is sponsored or paid? So, in this article let’s talk about this most ask questions.</p><p>With more people looking to make extra money these days, many companies have taken advantage of this and pay people to test their products before sending them to market.</p><p>What you need to understand is that companies are only looking for certain people to test product not all are qualified but there are certain that is willing to do some product testing or product review vlog.</p><p>Being a paid product reviewer is now easier than ever before, but it does take a little work and sometime good timing to get the right opportunity. Not only does being paid product reviewer get you some extra money, but you also get free products too!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Product-Review-Vlogs"><a href="#What-is-Product-Review-Vlogs" class="headerlink" title="What is Product Review Vlogs"></a>What is Product Review Vlogs</h2><p>When you think of YouTube reviews, you tend to think of videos where the YouTuber lays out the details of the product, perhaps talks about the kind of use cases you would want it for, and maybe even compares it to similar products. In reality, review videos can be ridiculously over the top or unconventional. But nevertheless, gives the viewer all the information that a review would give.</p><p>Product Review or Product testing is a way for companies to get real user feedback on a product or service before pushing it to market. To do this, companies ship you a free physical product to use in exchange for a candid review. At the end of the testing period, they typically let you keep the item. Some might even pay you in cash. But in case-to-case basis, most company varies to pay content creator when the channel audience statistics are good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/set-up-camera-mayang.jpg"                      alt="set up camera mayang"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid to Review Products"></a>How to Get Paid to Review Products</h2><p>You must have a channel that is stable in a sense with good statistics especially in the audience</p><p>There are companies that want you to have at least 1000 Subscribers on your YouTube channel and at least 1000 followers on Facebook page, Instagram and even TikTok account. Companies also choose YouTubers who they think can do what they want well. They also look at the audience statistic of the channel, from there they will also know what product they are offering and how much payment they can pay for the review.</p><p>One of the great things about YouTube, both as a source of income and as a creative outlet, is that there are so many ways to be successful.</p><p>This kind of work is not easy, especially when you’re doing a skin care products review there are times that the products is not suitable for your skin type, you can feel itchy and sore. So, you have to be very carefully in accepting products to review, do some research about the product ingredients, you know your skin type so it is easy for you to identified if it’s good for you or not. It’s not because you will receive free products and payment for review, immediately you will accept the offer, you must consider the product if its compatible to your skin because at the end of the day it’s your skin, it’s your channel who will sacrifice if you make a wrong decision.</p><p>The next universal thing you do is be honest with your viewers when making sponsored content.</p><p>This applies to YouTubers of all stripes, but even more so when we’re talking about YouTubers who review products. If you have been paid to do a particular review, regardless of whether the review is 100% honest and not flattering at all for the product, even if all the company did was send you a free product to do the review with and aren’t actually paying you, you need to tell your viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/product-review-video-mayang.jpg"                      alt="product review video mayang"                ></p><h2 id="How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee"><a href="#How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee" class="headerlink" title="How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee"></a>How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee</h2><p>As a YouTuber, talent fee is the fee given by the companies when a person reviews their product. The payments depend on your channel status and other social media account.</p><p>Sometime companies ask you to cross posted your review to all your social media account because based on them there are also followers on social media that is not a subscriber. They also want a wide market for you to post their products.</p><p>As for the charging of the companies, it depends on you, if you think your skills in vlogging are enough, then you can ask for higher payment but if you think the price is reasonable for your hard work just go for it. The companies will still negotiate with you regarding the price so you should open to that and should level the price you charge to the company with your work. Sometime they also offer an ex-deal, meaning half of the payment is products then half of it is money. Example you ask for payment like 100$, 250$ of that is worth of all products and the another 250$ will pay thru your preferred bank. So, you will receive a lot of product amounting of the asking price. The question is, what will you do of those products? You can have it for your raffles or giveaways for your channel in that way you can attract more viewers and subscriber and you can also sell that to convert the products into cash. But also check the contract if that way is allowed, because sometimes companies also have restrictions regarding ex-deals. Remember to always read carefully the contract before signing so you won’t have any problem in the long run.</p><p><strong>My Example of Rate Card</strong></p><p><strong>Rate of (Amount) for</strong></p><ol><li>1 YouTube Vlog about the product</li><li>1 IG repost of the YT Vlog (to be posted on feed) cross-posted to Facebook</li><li>1 IG Story</li><li>1 TikTok Video</li></ol><p><strong>Things to Remember to do a Quality Product Review Vlog</strong></p><p>In order for you to have paid product reviews you need to consider the following</p><p><strong>Quality Videos</strong></p><p>You need to make quality videos, because of course the companies don’t just look at the channel statistics, they also check if you make a video that approved to their standard. The video you make is will be used or posted to their website or other social media platform that is why work hard to make your video stand out to the company.</p><p><strong>Perfect Equipment for Vlogging</strong></p><p>Have at least the equipment for vlogging is good because of course it’s embarrassing for the company that you will receive payment and then the video is blurry and the audio is noisy. It’s about time to invest in the vlogging equipment if you receive such offer, that’s for the quality video’s sake.</p><p><strong>Quality Content</strong></p><p>It’s not just the video only that are good, the content should also be well made, think about your work carefully so that you don’t embarrass the brand and your subscriber. It’s not just that you review a product on the channel, you should also think of other ways to create quality content be creative and wise in making good content. Remember there are a lot of Youtuber that same content as you.</p><p><strong>Editing Software</strong></p><p>In order to say that you have made quality content and quality video, when it comes to editing your work must be done well. There are people who are good at editing, they give so much time and effort to make their video creative to stands out to other channel. As you know there are a lot of vloggers doing the same kind of content, so in order for you to stand out, you must put an effort to your editing.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> one of the most trusted video editing software when it comes to make quality videos.

This is due to the launch of platforms like Twitch and Youtube, which have made it easier for content creators&#x2F;streamers to reach a wide audience. But how do these two platforms differ?</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a comprehensive look at <strong>Twitch vs. Youtube</strong> by comparing their browsing, content rule leniency, growth, and monetization. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of which platform is right for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-vs-youtube.jpg"                      alt="twitch vs youtube"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube"></a>Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube</h2><p>Though Twitch and YouTube share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two:</p><p><strong>Browsing:</strong> Twitch and YouTube are search engines, but they differ in how they recommend videos to viewers. Twitch focuses on more popular streamers and doesn’t let users edit their thumbnails, while YouTube makes it easier for newbies to be found with a customizable thumbnail feature.</p><p><strong>Content Rule Leniency:</strong> Twitch and YouTube’s content guidelines are slightly different. YouTube is more easygoing when it comes to what videos can be posted. On the other hand, Twitch has a reputation for banning streamers without any justification. Even streamers with contracts seem to be treated the same as anyone else when this happens.</p><p><strong>Growth:</strong> YouTube offers more advantages over Twitch in terms of growth as it is more accessible and has a better algorithm that allows small content creators to grow their channels quickly. However, Twitch mainly focuses on popular content streamers and offers fewer growth opportunities for newbies.</p><p><strong>Monetization:</strong> When it comes to monetization, both platforms offer different options for content creators. On Twitch, content creators can earn revenue from subscriptions, sponsored advertisements, donations, affiliate programs, merchandise sales, etc. On YouTube, content creators can earn revenue from direct advertisements, sponsorships, partnership programs, streams, donations, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt="youtube monetization"                ></p><p><strong>Chat and Moderation Policies:</strong> Twitch uses a time-based strict chat moderation policy and does not have the pause or rewind option. While on YouTube, the chat is arranged based on relevance and comes with only standard emojis for visual presentation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Comparison of Two Important Features Between Twitch and YOUTUBE: Partnership and Gaming</h2><h3 id="YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership"><a href="#YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership" class="headerlink" title="YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership"></a>YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership</h3><p>Affiliate programs are accessible on both Twitch and YouTube with specific requirements that you need to adhere to. These include a consistent uploading or streaming schedule, viewer engagement on your content, certain watch times, and the required number of subscribers on your channel.</p><p>Unlike YouTube, Twitch offers both affiliate and partnership programs.

Over the past few years, two of the biggest platforms for streaming gaming content have been Twitch and YouTube. So which platform is worth using? Let’s find out!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-gaming.jpg"                      alt="twitch gaming"                ></p><p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Twitch algorithm is mainly based on the number of viewers on your videos. Moreover, when browsing, it mainly suggests only the popular streamers with a strong subscriber base.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube is owned by Google and creates more opportunities for streamers to be found. Also, its search algorithm takes into account the number of likes, comments, and shares on your video.</p><p><strong>Streamer-Viewer Dynamics:</strong> On Twitch, viewers often get more involved with the streamer as opposed to YouTube gaming viewers, who prefer to watch videos without commentary.</p><p><strong>Engagement Requirements For Streamers:</strong> To grow on YouTube, you need at least 4000 hours of watch time and a good number of likes, shares, and comments on your video. While on Twitch, you need at least a 20-30% engagement rate and a large number of subscribers.</p><p><strong>Competition Level Of Streamer:</strong> YouTube has fewer streamers but a 20 times more extensive user base. The potential for growth for new streamers is much higher due to the lower competition on the platform. Additionally, the platform provides more prominent exposure for new content creators.</p><h3 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h3><p>Twitch is a better streaming platform if you want to cultivate a following around your content. Although creating your followers’ community at first can be difficult, it largely depends on how engaging and compelling your content is.</p><p>As a new content creator or a streamer to create and upload pre-recorded videos, YouTube is a better choice for you. Make sure to upload the most enthralling games to keep your audience captivating and interested.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More"><a href="#Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?"></a>Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?</h2><p>The amount of revenue you can make on Twitch or YouTube is directly related to your follower base. The higher the number of followers&#x2F;viewers, the more you will earn. Here’s how each platform pays its streamers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094414/7443" target="_top" id="2094414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094414/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How Twitch Pay Their Streamers"></a>How Twitch Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>There are five ways in which you can make money while streaming your content on Twitch:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> You can turn on ads on your content when your stream gets the affiliate’s status. Ad revenues are based on the number of impressions (views) your content receives, and the average payout is $0.25 - $1.50 per 1,000 views.</p><p><strong>Bits</strong>: As a streamer on Twitch, you can also receive donations from your viewers in the form of a unique currency on the platform known as Bits. It’s important to note that Twitch takes a 29% cut-off of all donations made this way, leaving the streamer with 71% of the total donation. We have a complete guide to help you understand <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what Twitch Bits are and how to earn&#x2F;get them for free. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-bits.jpg"                      alt="twitch bits"                ></p><p><strong>Donations:</strong> Donations made through Paypal or other monetary exchange platforms benefit the streamer as they will receive 100% of the donation. This is the cheaper way of ensuring that the streamer gets the entire donation amount from the viewer.</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> Subscribers can support your channel by getting a subscription for a minimum of $4.99 per month. Twitch only takes 50% of subscription fees. This makes it much more profitable for streamers, as they can earn $2.50 per subscription per month.</p><p><strong>Merchandise:</strong> In terms of merchandise, Twitch has an advantage over YouTube because it comes with various merchandising extensions that can help you to make sales directly to your viewers during a live stream without the need for them to leave the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-monetization.jpg"                      alt="twitch monetization"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948895/19272" target="_top" id="1948895">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948895" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948895/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How YouTube Pay Their Streamers"></a>How YouTube Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>YouTube pays its streamers in three different ways:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> Once your channel reaches a specific threshold, you become eligible for displaying ads on your YouTube channel. YouTube ads pay more than Twitch. For each 1000 ad views, you will get $18, which means you can earn up to $3 to $5 per 1k video views.</p><p><strong>Members:</strong> YouTube members are equivalent to Twitch’s subscribers. YouTube pays 70% of membership fees to the creators. The eligibility to offer channel memberships opens up at 30,000 subscribers for all types of channels, but for gaming channels, in particular, a minimum of 1,000 subscribers are required. Additionally, creators must also be a part of the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p><strong>Super Chat:</strong> Youtube pays streamers 70% of each super chat donation made on the platform and retains 30%. While this may seem to be expensive, it helps cover the costs of hosting a Livestream. Without this donation, Youtube would not be able to function as smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-super-chat.jpg"                      alt="youtube super chat"                ></p><h3 id="Which-Pays-More"><a href="#Which-Pays-More" class="headerlink" title="Which Pays More?"></a>Which Pays More?</h3><p>Due to the lower threshold for monetization, Twitch pays more to the new content creators and offers more monetization options. However, it is difficult to grow on Twitch compared to YouTube, which has a stronger user base.</p><p>YouTube is easier to generate income in the long run as you can upload recorded gaming videos which can get more viewers as it is always available on the platform. Moreover, you can also make more from YouTube ads than on Twitch.</p><p><strong>Video - Where Should You Stream in 2022? - Twitch vs YouTube Live</strong></p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?"></a>How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?</h3><p>On YouTube, a streamer mainly gets paid based on the ads, which is $0.10 to $0.30 per ad view.

This is because you can fine-tune every video aspect, from the frame rate to the audio levels.</p><p><strong>Easier To Use:</strong> Desktop video editors are typically more straightforward to use than mobile apps. This is because they have a larger screen to work on and a more robust interface.</p><p>Thus, if you’re looking for a powerful and easy-to-use video editing app, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a great option.

Microsoft Teams, a platform for corporate collaboration, is part of the Microsoft 365 family of products. Teams provides file storage, application integration, workplace chat, and videoconferencing. Microsoft’s existing workplace communications and collaboration solutions, notably Skype for Business and Microsoft Classroom, will be replaced by Teams. With that in mind, we’ve compiled this guide to explain How to Zoom in Teams among the other features that would be helpful as a Team user.</p><p>Through Teams, users may talk with one another. Users do not need to check a discussion history since conversations on Teams are permanent, in contrast to Skype for Business. In conversations, users may format text and include emoticons. The user may designate a communication as urgent or important. Communications regarded as important have a red symbol. Along with real-time communications, Teams users may collaborate on documents. Microsoft has a considerable competitive edge over competitors as you can learn How to Zoom out in Microsoft Teams. Follow the guide below to learn how to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="zoom microsoft teams"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Way-to-Zoom-in-Teams"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Way-to-Zoom-in-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Way to Zoom in Teams"></a>Part 1: Best Way to Zoom in Teams</h2><p>By visiting a certain online address or receiving an invitation from the team administrator, communities, organizations, or teams may join Teams.

The only difference is whether iOS or Windows is being used. With the Windows operating system, just use the keyboard to zoom in.

The goal of this group of technologies is to raise employee productivity. On-screen zooming and camera zooming for meetings are the two types of zoom functionality that Microsoft Teams users are most interested in. The user interface can be zoomed in since it is natively supported, however the camera cannot be zoomed in without the use of third-party software.</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft Teams does not provide native camera controls. A camera-controlling app with zoom-in&#x2F;zoom-out features would be necessary. You may try YouCam for that. YouCam Perfect’s new image-enhancing features enable you to create magazine-quality portraits from your selfies. The program comes in two versions, one of which is free and the other is a paid version.</p><p>YouCam is a program intended to control and use webcams. The webcam or any other camera that is linked to the computer may be accessed by this program, which is highly powerful. The free version comes with the basic zoom in&#x2F;out capabilities, but it also has sceneries, emoticons, and filters. Other unique features of the YouCam Perfect program include an immediate beautifier, a tool to improve skin tone, a physique enhancer, a collage builder, and a social network as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/youcam-zoom-camera.jpg"                      alt="youcam zoom camera"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-to-Zoom-in-Teams-Using-YouCam"><a href="#Steps-to-Zoom-in-Teams-Using-YouCam" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Zoom in Teams Using YouCam:"></a><strong>Steps to Zoom in Teams Using YouCam:</strong></h3><p>The process to enabling CyberLink YouCam will vary depending on the sort of instant messaging program you are using.

Nowadays with the rise of technology, we don’t find it mandatory to use the computer for editing our photos and videos rather people have switched towards the tablet. Tablet is one of the ideal tools for video editing purposes as it is easy to carry and manage than a computer.

I am sure these are the things that would make your confusion of finding the best tablet for you much easier.</p><h4 id="Battery-life"><a href="#Battery-life" class="headerlink" title="Battery life"></a>Battery life</h4><p>This is one of the most important factors to look upon as you would be working for some long hours and carrying it throughout the day with you. You can check about the battery life one by watching videos and the second is with web browsing. The better one is watching videos as it eats up more battery and is easy to find about the battery life. Also, keep 8 hours as a running battery time as a standard time of checking about battery life.</p><h4 id="Storage-space"><a href="#Storage-space" class="headerlink" title="Storage space"></a>Storage space</h4><p>Though the storage space of a tablet would be lesser than the laptop it is surely a factor to look upon. Most of the tablets come between 8GB and 64GB which is small than desktops. So if you are planning to store high-definition files and software then you need to find the higher capacity tablet.</p><h4 id="Size-and-weight"><a href="#Size-and-weight" class="headerlink" title="Size and weight"></a>Size and weight</h4><p>Most of the time you must be carrying the tablet in your hands so checking the size and weight is important because you don’t want the device to be heavy for you. The lighter is better so check the size and weight while purchasing to make your hands burden-free.</p><h4 id="Budget"><a href="#Budget" class="headerlink" title="Budget"></a>Budget</h4><p>Every buying decision starts from deciding the budget at first so while picking any tablet you need to keep in mind your purchase limit so that you can make a list of those which are under your budget and on that basis you can choose the best tablet for photo editing.</p><h4 id="Display"><a href="#Display" class="headerlink" title="Display"></a>Display</h4><p>So display should be given priority as well while buying any tablet-like size of the display, resolution, brightness, coating, view angle, etc. things. Also for watching movies and entertainment stuff look for an HD resolution of a minimum 720p and an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-8-Tablets-to-Edit-Photos-Smoothly"><a href="#Part-2-Top-8-Tablets-to-Edit-Photos-Smoothly" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 8 Tablets to Edit Photos Smoothly"></a>Part 2: Top 8 Tablets to Edit Photos Smoothly</h2><p>Now it is time to talk about each of the best tablets for photo editing in detail one by one.</p><h4 id="1-iPad-Pro"><a href="#1-iPad-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1.iPad Pro"></a>1.iPad Pro</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-editing-tablet-ipadpro.jpg"                      alt="photo editing tablet ipadpro"                ></p><p>This is among the best pic for tablets in terms of photo editing in the market.

Even after several years since this feature has been available on the iPad, Apple just added the feature to iPhones with the launch of iOS 14. This feature is a nice creation as it helps users perform numerous tasks and not only focus on one event.</p><p>Thanks to this invention, users can reply to customers’ emails while closing a new lead on Facetime. This article will teach you how to enable and disable the picture in picture mode in Safari on Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for Mac</h2><p>Picture-in-Picture PiP mode is a feature that allows you to view movies in a tiny floating window while surfing another website in Safari or doing something else on your Mac. It remains in the foreground of your screen regardless of which new program you start on your PC.</p><p>To experience Picture in Picture on Mac, you must first launch Safari. You may use Safari’s PiP mode on any video content website. Other browsers do not currently support this functionality.</p><p>Another consideration is that some websites may not support Picture in Picture. In this situation, you will be unable to watch your chosen videos unless you use particular programs that support them. However, because each site operates differently, the procedure you must use to enter this mode may differ.</p><h3 id="Entry-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac"><a href="#Entry-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Entry Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac"></a>Entry Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac</h3><p>Let’s have a look at how to use Picture in Picture in Safari on Mac:</p><ul><li>After you start Safari, you may go to any website you choose.</li><li>Find the videos you wish to view and press the play button.</li><li>Once it starts playing, you will notice a <strong>small sound icon</strong> at the top tab; you can <strong>right-click or hold control</strong> while clicking on this icon.</li><li>You will notice a drop-down where you can select the <strong>“Enter Picture in Picture.”</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-2.jpg"                      alt="enter picture in picture"                ></p><ul><li>Suppose you opened the video tab only; you will see the small sound icon in the address bar. But if you open other tabs, in that case, you will see the small sound icon on the right side of the tab.</li></ul><p>You can see that utilizing Picture in Picture in Safari for Mac is simple, straightforward, and adaptable. Let’s look at how to get the most of this feature now.</p><h3 id="Using-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac"><a href="#Using-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Using Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac"></a>Using Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac</h3><p>When you enable this feature, the video will shrink and move to a corner on Mac’s screen while still playing. You can perform several tasks to your taste as you keep watching and working. If you feel the size is too small or big, you can resize it by dragging any corner of the video. Furthermore, you can click and pull it to any side of the window if it disturbs your view.</p><p>There is a play and pause button available also as well as the forward and backward if you wish to perform any of these activities. And again, you can decide to turn off this feature by repeating the procedure where you locate the small sound icon. But here, you select the mute this tab instead or click the “<strong>X”</strong> button at the top left corner to stop the video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148641/16836" target="_top" id="2148641">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148641" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="254" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148641/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for iPhone</h2><p>As we have discussed earlier, users have a way to enable the picture in picture mode before launching iOS14, where the feature is incorporated in the settings. Thanks to Apple’s new APIs, this functionality is no longer limited to watching videos while working on other apps with iOS 15. However, the following procedure is how you can enable the picture in picture mode on your iPhone.</p><ul><li>Go to your iPhone’s <strong>“Settings”</strong> and scroll to the <strong>General</strong></li><li>Search for <strong>Picture in Picture</strong> in the <strong>General</strong> section and click on the option.</li><li>Once it opens, you will see a toggle button for <strong>Start PiP Automatically</strong>; turn it <strong>ON</strong> to enable it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-3.jpg"                      alt="start pip automatically"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012415/19272" target="_top" id="2012415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012415/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Note:</strong> You perform the above procedure also to disable the feature.

In the case of aligning, depending on your choice, it could be to the screen’s top right, bottom right, top left, and bottom left.</p><p>To move the window to any screen part, simply tap and hold the video to drag and place it on any part of the screen you want. Another fantastic feature the iPhone offers is that it allows you to minimize the picture-in-picture window, and you will keep listening to the audio part of the video while working on other apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-4.jpg"                      alt="move the window to any screen part"                ></p><p>To perform this minimizing feature, grab the window and move it to either side of the screen’s edge.

How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for iPad</h2><p>The picture in picture mode has been available on the iPad long before it was incorporated into other Apple products. However, enabling it on the iPad is one of the easiest things to do. Furthermore, disabling this feature follows the procedure you followed when enabling it. Following the procedures highlighted below will help you enable and disable PiP on your iPad:</p><ul><li>On your iPad, go to <strong>“Settings”</strong>.</li><li>Locate the <strong>“General”</strong></li><li>Scroll to the <strong>“Multitasking and Dock”</strong>.</li><li>Here, toggle picture in picture ON to enable this feature; otherwise, toggle picture in picture OFF to disable the feature.</li></ul><p>Above all, you need to have it in the back of your mind that regardless of how you enable this feature, the app or website needs to support the picture in picture mode to work correctly. However, almost all website supports this feature, with YouTube being the top supporter.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Going through emails in the morning while viewing news videos in Picture-in-Picture mode can help you save time. You don’t have to launch a new Safari window or rely on Split View, which consumes important screen space while multitasking.</p><p>Aside from Safari, the Picture-in-Picture mode is available in other standard programs like QuickTime and Apple TV.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Are-Bloggers-Getting-Cash-for-Product-Insights"><a href="#Are-Bloggers-Getting-Cash-for-Product-Insights" class="headerlink" title="Are Bloggers Getting Cash for Product Insights?"></a>Are Bloggers Getting Cash for Product Insights?</h2><p>Every time I talk to a friend, they always ask me if everything I do on YouTube is paid? Or are the products that I’m doing a review is sponsored or paid? So, in this article let’s talk about this most ask questions.</p><p>With more people looking to make extra money these days, many companies have taken advantage of this and pay people to test their products before sending them to market.</p><p>What you need to understand is that companies are only looking for certain people to test product not all are qualified but there are certain that is willing to do some product testing or product review vlog.</p><p>Being a paid product reviewer is now easier than ever before, but it does take a little work and sometime good timing to get the right opportunity. Not only does being paid product reviewer get you some extra money, but you also get free products too!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Product-Review-Vlogs"><a href="#What-is-Product-Review-Vlogs" class="headerlink" title="What is Product Review Vlogs"></a>What is Product Review Vlogs</h2><p>When you think of YouTube reviews, you tend to think of videos where the YouTuber lays out the details of the product, perhaps talks about the kind of use cases you would want it for, and maybe even compares it to similar products. In reality, review videos can be ridiculously over the top or unconventional. But nevertheless, gives the viewer all the information that a review would give.</p><p>Product Review or Product testing is a way for companies to get real user feedback on a product or service before pushing it to market. To do this, companies ship you a free physical product to use in exchange for a candid review. At the end of the testing period, they typically let you keep the item. Some might even pay you in cash. But in case-to-case basis, most company varies to pay content creator when the channel audience statistics are good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/set-up-camera-mayang.jpg"                      alt="set up camera mayang"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid to Review Products"></a>How to Get Paid to Review Products</h2><p>You must have a channel that is stable in a sense with good statistics especially in the audience</p><p>There are companies that want you to have at least 1000 Subscribers on your YouTube channel and at least 1000 followers on Facebook page, Instagram and even TikTok account. Companies also choose YouTubers who they think can do what they want well. They also look at the audience statistic of the channel, from there they will also know what product they are offering and how much payment they can pay for the review.</p><p>One of the great things about YouTube, both as a source of income and as a creative outlet, is that there are so many ways to be successful.</p><p>This kind of work is not easy, especially when you’re doing a skin care products review there are times that the products is not suitable for your skin type, you can feel itchy and sore. So, you have to be very carefully in accepting products to review, do some research about the product ingredients, you know your skin type so it is easy for you to identified if it’s good for you or not. It’s not because you will receive free products and payment for review, immediately you will accept the offer, you must consider the product if its compatible to your skin because at the end of the day it’s your skin, it’s your channel who will sacrifice if you make a wrong decision.</p><p>The next universal thing you do is be honest with your viewers when making sponsored content.</p><p>This applies to YouTubers of all stripes, but even more so when we’re talking about YouTubers who review products. If you have been paid to do a particular review, regardless of whether the review is 100% honest and not flattering at all for the product, even if all the company did was send you a free product to do the review with and aren’t actually paying you, you need to tell your viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/product-review-video-mayang.jpg"                      alt="product review video mayang"                ></p><h2 id="How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee"><a href="#How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee" class="headerlink" title="How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee"></a>How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee</h2><p>As a YouTuber, talent fee is the fee given by the companies when a person reviews their product. The payments depend on your channel status and other social media account.</p><p>Sometime companies ask you to cross posted your review to all your social media account because based on them there are also followers on social media that is not a subscriber. They also want a wide market for you to post their products.</p><p>As for the charging of the companies, it depends on you, if you think your skills in vlogging are enough, then you can ask for higher payment but if you think the price is reasonable for your hard work just go for it. The companies will still negotiate with you regarding the price so you should open to that and should level the price you charge to the company with your work. Sometime they also offer an ex-deal, meaning half of the payment is products then half of it is money. Example you ask for payment like 100$, 250$ of that is worth of all products and the another 250$ will pay thru your preferred bank. So, you will receive a lot of product amounting of the asking price. The question is, what will you do of those products? You can have it for your raffles or giveaways for your channel in that way you can attract more viewers and subscriber and you can also sell that to convert the products into cash. But also check the contract if that way is allowed, because sometimes companies also have restrictions regarding ex-deals. Remember to always read carefully the contract before signing so you won’t have any problem in the long run.</p><p><strong>My Example of Rate Card</strong></p><p><strong>Rate of (Amount) for</strong></p><ol><li>1 YouTube Vlog about the product</li><li>1 IG repost of the YT Vlog (to be posted on feed) cross-posted to Facebook</li><li>1 IG Story</li><li>1 TikTok Video</li></ol><p><strong>Things to Remember to do a Quality Product Review Vlog</strong></p><p>In order for you to have paid product reviews you need to consider the following</p><p><strong>Quality Videos</strong></p><p>You need to make quality videos, because of course the companies don’t just look at the channel statistics, they also check if you make a video that approved to their standard. The video you make is will be used or posted to their website or other social media platform that is why work hard to make your video stand out to the company.</p><p><strong>Perfect Equipment for Vlogging</strong></p><p>Have at least the equipment for vlogging is good because of course it’s embarrassing for the company that you will receive payment and then the video is blurry and the audio is noisy. It’s about time to invest in the vlogging equipment if you receive such offer, that’s for the quality video’s sake.</p><p><strong>Quality Content</strong></p><p>It’s not just the video only that are good, the content should also be well made, think about your work carefully so that you don’t embarrass the brand and your subscriber. It’s not just that you review a product on the channel, you should also think of other ways to create quality content be creative and wise in making good content. Remember there are a lot of Youtuber that same content as you.</p><p><strong>Editing Software</strong></p><p>In order to say that you have made quality content and quality video, when it comes to editing your work must be done well. There are people who are good at editing, they give so much time and effort to make their video creative to stands out to other channel. As you know there are a lot of vloggers doing the same kind of content, so in order for you to stand out, you must put an effort to your editing.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> one of the most trusted video editing software when it comes to make quality videos.

Honesty is perhaps more important than usual in for reviewers, however, since the risk of being caught lying is substantial. If it gets out that you are being dishonest in your reviews, you can essentially kiss goodbye to any hope of making money with product reviews on YouTube.</p><p>Just remember that companies are paying for your time and honest so they can bring products to public that are going to perform well, your input makes a difference for everyone not to mention you get free products and make extra money at the same time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/edit-product-vlog-filmora.jpg"                      alt="edit product vlog filmora"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044583/7443" target="_top" id="2044583">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044583" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044583/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Product review videos are an excellent way to earn money through YouTube, in no small part because a love of the subject matter is not necessary for success.

Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="icon note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Click <a class="link"   href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/one-dev-minute/how-to-use-the-azure-cognitive-services-net-speech-sdk-for-recognition" >this video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a detailed guide on how to use Azure Speech Services with Visual Basic (SDK).</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?</h2><p>We should all agree that using Microsoft Azures Speech Service is not a walk in the park. You need some knowledge of programming and Windows Command Prompt. Even worse, you’ll have to pay each time you want to convert speech to text after depleting the free credits.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s no shortage of free speech to text converters for beginners. So, in this part, we’ll discuss some free Microsoft Azure STT alternatives for beginners.</p><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s a video editor for creating award-winning videos without prior editing skills. Just upload your local video and edit it as you please. And yes, it works with a host of video formats.</p><p>When you want to make perfect videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos"><a href="#Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora To Make STT videos"></a>Use Filmora To Make STT videos</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs. After dictating enough texts, tap the red Microphone icon and edit your text. It’s that simple!</p><h3 id="3-Audtext-60-one-time-fee"><a href="#3-Audtext-60-one-time-fee" class="headerlink" title="3.Audtext - $60 one-time fee"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://audext.com/" >Audtext <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - $60 one-time fee</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-7.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text alternative audtext"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087390/7443" target="_top" id="2087390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If Google’s voice recognition service is too slow for your liking, consider Audtext. It’s a highly rated online program that uses cutting-edge machine learning technology to transcribe audio to text in 60+ languages. You can easily train this program to identify the speaker in your interview or podcast file.</p><p>Meanwhile, Audtext can transcribe typical video and audio formats, including MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, and more. And after transcribing audio to text, exploit the inbuilt text editor to retouch and make your text presentable.</p><p>Let’s find out how this STT service works:</p><p>Step1Create a transcription account on Audtext and click New Upload to choose the transcription mode. You can select the automatic transcription that uses AI or professional real-human transcription. So, let’s choose Automatic.</p><p>Step2Drag-n-drop your video or audio file on the program and then choose the transcription language. After adding your file, click Upload to scan and transcribe it. This should take a while.</p><p>Step3Finally, click the transcribed text file to edit it with new texts and punctuations on the inbuilt editor. You can export your transcription in .txt, .srt, or .docx formats. Directly export to Google Drive is also available.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Up to this point, you should be ready to get started with the <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. The speech-to-text feature allows you to convert unlimited voices to text on your computer.
